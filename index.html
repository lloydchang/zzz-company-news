It answers questions about coverage, treatment, and benefits, provides advice on preventative care, and helps employers with the enrolment process.\n\nThe round was co-led by Fin Capital, Glilot Capital Partners, and Group11, with strategic partner TriNet also taking part. It will also be used for product development, according to the Israeli company, which was formed in 2018.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019sAktiiahas raised CHF 27 million ($30 million) from investors including Redalpine and Khosla Ventures for the rollout and development of its wearable wristband device, which uses photoplethysmography technology to provide continuous blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period by detecting blood volume changes in small blood vessels.\n\nThe device is already approved in 44 countries and available in Switzerland, Germany, France, Austria, Italy, the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, and have been used in more than 60,000 patients. Aktiia will use the new funding in part to fund an expansion into the US market.\n\nHealthcare data exchange specialistMoxe Healthhas raised $25 million from investor Trinity Capital to support the development of its technology platform, used for the secure exchange of clinical and other sensitive data between healthcare payers and providers.\n\nIt is designed to provide a solution to the current problem of health data being in different formats and silos, with the aim of reducing administrative waste, relieving pressure on healthcare staff, eliminating duplicative efforts, and ultimately lowering costs. The latest cash infusion follows a $30 million second round in 2022 and a $5.5 million Series A for the Madison, Wisconsin-based company.\n\nEleanor Health, a company providing digital and face-to-face support for people struggling with substance use disorders (SUDs) and their families, has raised $22 million in an equity raise, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe Massachusetts-based start-up \u2013 which recently saw founding CEO Corbin Petro step down and be replaced by William McKinney \u2013 offers personalised addiction treatment either virtually or in person through a series of clinics in six US states. The latest round comes after it raised $50 million in Series C funding in 2022 and takes the total raised to date above the $100 million mark.\n\nNew York-basedTava Healthhas closed a $20 million Series B led by Catalyst Investors and featuring existing investors Peterson Partners, Toba Capital, and SpringTide, along with new backer Blue Heron Capital.\n\nThe company provides a telemedicine platform focused on mental health, connecting patients to therapists and supporting healthcare providers with practice management software, electronic medical records, and interactions with employers and health insurance companies. It said the new money would be used for product development, expansion of its provider network, and fostering new agreements with payers.\n\nBrainCheckhas raised $15 million that will be used to fuel the expansion and take-up of a recently launched update to its BrainCheck Screen digital cognitive assessment and care planning software for people with dementia. The app allows testing to be carried out on any internet-connect device and delivers an initial assessment in three minutes.\n\nThe financing round was led by Next Coast Ventures, S3 Ventures, and UPMC Enterprises, according to the Austin, Texas-based company, which said it would help accelerate the rollout of the new version.\n\nFinally, analytics companyRedi Healthhas closed a $14 million second round led by Blue Heron Capital that will be used to develop and expand its digital patient support programme (PSP) for people suffering from chronic health conditions.\n\nThe Columbus, Ohio start-up provides a number of services to its customers, including an app that tracks medications, symptoms, diet, and weight, and allows them to communicate and share progress with healthcare providers and link to other pertinent organisations, like drugmakers, pharmacies, and payers. It was founded in 2022, raising just under $4 million in a first round in 2022.", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Dermala", "title": "No news", "url": "", "source": "", "body": "", "date": "2025-05-16", "full_content": "", "extraction_status": "not_attempted"}, {"company": "Oralucent", "title": "No news", "url": "", "source": "", "body": "", "date": "2025-05-16", "full_content": "", "extraction_status": "not_attempted"}, {"company": "Flowly", "title": "No news", "url": "", "source": "", "body": "", "date": "2025-05-16", "full_content": "", "extraction_status": "not_attempted"}, {"company": "Rosy Wellness", "title": "No news", "url": "", "source": "", "body": "", "date": "2025-05-16", "full_content": "", "extraction_status": "not_attempted"}, {"company": "De Oro Devices", "title": "No news", "url": "", "source": "", "body": "", "date": "2025-05-16", "full_content": "", "extraction_status": "not_attempted"}, {"company": "Partum Health", "title": "No news", "url": "", "source": "", "body": "", "date": "2025-05-16", "full_content": "", "extraction_status": "not_attempted"}, {"company": "Fort Health", "title": "No news", "url": "", "source": "", "body": "", "date": "2025-05-16", "full_content": "", "extraction_status": "not_attempted"}, {"company": "RubyWell", "title": "No news", "url": "", "source": "", "body": "", "date": "2025-05-16", "full_content": "", "extraction_status": "not_attempted"}, {"company": "Atlantic Sea Farms", "title": "Mikel Durham out as interim CEO as US kelp farmer Atlantic Sea Farms downsizes", "url": "https://www.undercurrentnews.com/2025/05/01/mikel-durham-out-as-interim-ceo-as-us-kelp-farmer-atlantic-sea-farms-downsizes/", "source": "Undercurrent News", "body": "Mikel Durham, a board member of US kelp producer Atlantic Sea Farms and its recently appointed interim CEO, is no longer with the company as it undergoes downsizing [...]", "date": "2025-05-01", "full_content": "Kiera Foti, a brand manager with Atlantic Sea Farms, announced on LinkedIn that she was laid off as the Maine-based kelp producer is 'scaling back and restructuring'\n\nMikel Durham, a board member of US kelp producer Atlantic Sea Farms and its recently appointed interim CEO, is no longer with the company as it undergoes downsizing [...]\n\nSign up for a trial to have access to our articles!\n\nWe\u2019ve sent a link toto change your password.\n\nPlease check your inbox to reset your password securely and easily.\n\nContact the author[email\u00a0protected]\n\nGet recommendations, data, editor\u2019s picks, and the latest news from around the seafood world straight to your inbox.\n\nWill be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Policy", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "VidaFuel", "title": "No news", "url": "", "source": "", "body": "", "date": "2025-05-16", "full_content": "", "extraction_status": "not_attempted"}, {"company": "Aloqia", "title": "Shein increases use of deadstock fabric by 40% in 2024", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-xl/news/other/shein-increases-use-of-deadstock-fabric-by-40-in-2024/ar-AA1CbCXN", "source": "MSN", "body": "Since 2022, Shein has sourced over 47,900 metres of deadstock fabric through Aloqia, leading to estimated savings of 357,600 cubic metres of water, 7,400 kilograms of chemicals, and 70 metric tons ...", "date": "2025-04-03", "full_content": "Note: Content could not be properly extracted from this source.

Their technology can be integrated into existing recycling infrastructures to sort materials and ensure they\u2019re processed using the right methods, helping recyclers turn textile waste into new, usable fibers.\n\nSince the Circular Fashion Fund\u2019s launch in 2022, it has supported 27 businesses and by the end of 2025 will have invested a total of\u00a0$1.2 million\u00a0alongside over 200 hours of mentoring from industry experts.

The investment from eBay Ventures will help us close a significant round of fundraising for the business, allowing us to expand our technology to new recycling partners, strengthen our AI capabilities, and move faster toward our mission of enabling true textile-to-textile recycling. The journey for a startup is tough, so having the mentorship and access to eBay and the CFDA\u2019s networks has already proven invaluable.
