In order to save the app, Trump gave the social media site until April 5 to divest and find a U.S.-based owner.\n\nUnderhis previous term, Trump was the acting force seeking to ban TikTok in the U.S. But the Presidentseemed favorabletowards the app following his election win, citing it as part of why he secured support from young voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We have a lot of potential buyers,\" Trump said on Air Force One Sunday. \"I'd like to see Tiktok remain alive.\" Trump indicated that he would extend the deadline if a deal was not finalized. China has indicated that it would not support the forced sale of TikTok.\n\nThe latest tussle is just the most recent development in the long legal battle to keep TikTok available in the U.S. Efforts to ban TikTok in Montana wereoverturnedby a federal judge in 2023 after creators filed suit against the state.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know.\n\nTikTok is owned by its Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance. Sixty percent of the company is owned by investors including Carlyle Group, General Atlantic, and Susquehanna International Group,according to TikTok\u2019s U.S. Data Security page. The remaining 40% is divided between ByteDance employees and the founder of ByteDance.\n\nTikTok is not available in mainland China and has headquarters in Los Angeles and Singapore.\n\nBut its parent company does have to comply with Chinese law because it operates other video first platforms such asDouyin, the Chinese-equivalent of TikTok. The Chinese government therefore has a \u201cgolden share\u201d of one of its subsidiaries, Douyin, owning about 1% of that app.\n\nCongress passed a TikTok ban as part of a foreign aid supplemental package, citing national security concerns. Lawmakers were particularly concerned that the company could share data with the Chinese government or interfere with users\u2019 algorithms in a way that would benefit the foreign government. Chinese national security laws require any companies or organizations to cooperate with the country\u2019s national intelligence efforts.\n\n\u201cCongress is not acting to punish ByteDance, TikTok or any other individual company,\u201d Senate Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell said inApril 2024. \u201cCongress is acting to prevent foreign adversaries from conducting espionage, surveillance, maligned operations, harming vulnerable Americans, our servicemen and women, and our U.S. government personnel.\u201d\n\nAlready, the app is not permitted on any government-owned devices in the U.S. Other countries, including India have banned TikTok for all users since 2020, while Australia and Canada similarly forbade TikTok from operating on any devices issued by the federal government.\n\nThe current April 5 deadline was issued via Executive Order. Trump could possibly issue another such order to extend the deadline.\n\nThe last time the app was banned, U.S.-based users were unable to comment, share, or view any videos. \u201cA law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can\u2019t use TikTok for now,\u201d a message on a gray background read during theone-day TikTok pause.\n\nEven when the app was restored, TikTok was unavailable for download on the Apple and Google Play stores until mid-February.\n\nIt is unclear whether another potential ban would function similarly to the previous one.", "extraction_status": "success"}, {"company": "ByteDance", "title": "Trump Says TikTok Deal Will Be Secured Before Saturday Deadline", "url": "https://www.inc.com/rebecca-deczynski/trump-says-tiktok-deal-will-be-secured-before-saturday-deadline/91169426", "source": "Inc.com", "body": "President Donald Trump said a deal with TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the short video app used by 170 million Americans would be struck before a deadline on Saturday.", "date": "2025-03-31T18:30:00+00:00", "full_content": "Content extraction failed: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/rebecca-deczynski/trump-says-tiktok-deal-will-be-secured-before-saturday-deadline/91169426", "extraction_status": "success"}, {"company": "OpenAI", "title": "OpenAI has opened the floodgates for ChatGPT to make previously banned images", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/openai-has-opened-the-floodgates-for-chatgpt-to-make-previously-banned-images/ar-AA1C0WKM", "source": "Tom's Guide", "body": "Upon request, ChatGPT will now make images of public figures, hateful symbols, and potentially controversial posts", "date": "2025-03-31T15:56:34+00:00", "full_content": "Note: Content could not be properly extracted from this source.

But is it all as it seems?", "date": "2025-03-31T14:00:00+00:00", "full_content": "When David Hachfeld saw Shein\u2019s press release extolling what the e-tail Goliath said was the continuation of its \u201cdrumbeat of support\u201d for the factories in its supply chain, his immediate thought was that it sounded like the \u201csame old PR tactics.\u201d\n\nHachfeld is the textiles expert at Public Eye, a Swiss watchdog group whose investigations into Shein\u2019s Chinese supply chain, mostrecently in 2024, uncovered widespread evidence of excessive overtime, poverty wages and dangerous conditions, often in violation of local labor laws. He greeted with skepticism the Singapore-headquartered firm\u2019s claims that it would be earmarking$70 millionuntil 2028 to \u201cempower its ecosystem of third-party manufacturing suppliers and the workers within.\u201d It was the same feeling he felt when he saw Shein\u2019s photos of gleaming factory floors, polished canteens and even a newly renovated \u201cmultipurpose\u201d recreation room.\n\nMore from Sourcing Journal\n\nAsia-to-US Air Cargo Buoying Global Demand, Rates\n\nChina's Antitrust Regulator Preps Probe of Panama Ports Deal\n\n'A Stain on Humanity': What Canceled ILAB Grants Mean for Fashion Production\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite telling that while they boast in detail about every square meter renovated at a supplier, they still steadfastly refuse to disclose their authorized supplier list,\u201d he said. \u201cCredibility and secrecy don\u2019t go together. And this lack of transparency makes it impossible to independently verify their claims of improvement.\u201d\n\nShein, which doesn\u2019t operate its own facilities but rather contracts from a vast network of partners, said it has to date upgraded 203 factories spanning 500,000 square meters as part of its so-calledSupplier Community Empowerment Program, which it unveiled in 2022 on the heels of allegations byBritain\u2019s Channel 4that employees at two Guangzhou suppliers were toiling 18-hour days, with only one day off per month, for as little as 3 cents per hour. TheTemu nemesisrefuted most of the claims, denying, for instance, that the factories withheld or deducted wages if mistakes were made or quotas unmet. As of 2024, Shein has disbursed more than $33 million to SCEP initiatives in southern China, including $7.5 million for factory upgrades and expansion, $280,000 for the construction or renovation of canteens for workers and $430,000 to build or enhance free accommodation options for migrant workers.\n\nBut Hachfeld would need to see it to believe it, he said.\n\n\u201cIn 2023, when we looked into Shein\u2019s claims about their Supplier Community Empowerment Program and revisited production clusters in Guangzhou, we unfortunately couldn\u2019t confirm any tangible improvements on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, workers interviewed at different manufacturing sites reported again severe violations of labor standards, including shocking 75-hour work weeks. We asked Shein to disclose the facilities supposedly covered by the program back then, but they refused to be transparent, and they continue to refuse their suppliers to this day.\u201d\n\nThese were the days, as rumor had it, when Shein was still pursuing a U.S. initial public offering. But bipartisan backlash from Capitol Hill, which urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to hold off with registration until the fast fashion purveyor could independently certify that it didn\u2019t use forced labor from China\u2019s persecuted Uyghur minority, sent Shein\u2014reportedly\u2014to seek a float in London, where it was criticized at aparliamentary hearingfor failing to say whether it uses Chinese cotton, 90 percent of which hails from Xinjiang. (The answer, as it turned out?It depends, Shein appeared to say in a written response later.)\n\nBy all appearances, Shein\u2019s provision of summer camps for hundreds of workers\u2019 children, a commitment to establish and staff dozens of childcare centers for free afterschool care, and its offer of financial assistance for funding medical expenses, children\u2019s education or \u201cother personal challenges\u201d would be good things.\n\nNot so, however, for author and Columbia University fashion policy and sustainability lecturer Elizabeth Cline, who said that she found all of this \u201chonestly disturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should a person working for multi-billion dollar Shein need \u2018financial aid\u2019 for health expenses?\u201d she said. \u201cThese programs raise questions that urgently need to be answered: Are the childcare services running after school, or do they exist so parents can work well into the night? Are parents paid enough to feed and house their kids, or does the company-owned dormitory exist to keep wages at a level of dependence?\u201d\n\nDitto with the \u201ctechnology enhancements\u201d that theMissguided ownersays it\u2019s investing in through research and development at its sprawling Centre of Innovation for Garment Manufacturing in Guangzhou\u2014the same one that agroup of influencerstoured in 2023 to public ridicule and outrage. Shein said it has spent more than $23 million on developing innovative \u201clean production\u201d solutions for garment manufacturing, such as the use of automated guided vehicles. In 2024, the center submitted 30 patents for new technology that Shein says are employed in complex craftsmanship methods, including dealing with specialized fabrics.\n\nCline isn\u2019t sold. \u201cShein is primarily investing in more automated machinery to speed up production,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not need faster fast fashion. It threatens to push garment workers to sew faster, does nothing to improve the lives of workers, and will add more waste and consumerism to our world that only benefits these giant companies and their shareholders.\u201d\n\nKatrina Caspelich, chief marketing officer at the fashion advocacy group Remake, is well-versed in PR speak. She said that at first glance, Shein\u2019s Supplier Community Empowerment Program \u201creads like a well-crafted PR play: full of big numbers, strategic facility upgrades and worker-focused initiatives.\u201d But she also urged those scanning it not to be \u201cblinded by the flashy headline.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s focus on the root cause of why Shein\u2019s supply chain has needed such a massive overhaul in the first place,\u201d Caspelich said. \u201cShein built its empire on an ultra-fast fashion model that thrives on rapid production speeds, low costs, and a lack of transparency. The brand\u2019s historical issues with worker exploitation, unpaid wages, excessive overtime and evenchild labor allegationsaren\u2019t solved by upgrading canteens or adding robots to factory floors.\u201d\n\nA $70 million largesse may sound impressive, she said, but Shein was valued at $66 billion\u2014with a b\u2014in 2023. It\u2019s Caspelich\u2019s belief that its commitment is a \u201ctiny drop in the bucket\u201d that is more about making a good public impression than driving meaningful improvements.\n\n\u201cThe true test isn\u2019t how many childcare centers they open or how many QR codes workers can scan for financial assistance; it\u2019s whether Shein will fundamentally change the exploitative business model that fuels its success,\u201d she said. \u201cGenuine change would mean slowing down production, ensuring living wages, embracing transparency, and allowing independent audits\u2014not just controlled,self-reported narratives.\u201d\n\nShein has said that any supply chain partner that signs its code of conduct must agree to shun the use of forced labor, including prison and bonded labor, while complying with the International Labour Organisation\u2019s forced labor conventions in their direct or indirect procurement activities. Even so, audits, as experts have previously pointed out, are especially inadequate when it comes to state-sponsored forced labor, which is what Beijing is beingaccused of promotingboth in and outside of Xinjiang.\n\nHachfeld didn\u2019t mince words. \u201cHonestly, Shein should stop trying to distract with summer camps and charity programs for workers in need,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they really need to focus on is [to] ensure that all workers in their supply chain, from the seamstress to the warehouse picker, earn living wages within regular working hours and social security so they don\u2019t need charity in the first place.\u201d", "extraction_status": "success"}, {"company": "SHEIN", "title": "Step Into Panem: SHEIN and Lionsgate Drop The Hunger Games Collection", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/step-panem-shein-lionsgate-drop-130000976.html", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "body": "Today, global fashion and lifestyle online retailer SHEIN, announced the launch of its The Hunger Games franchise collection in collaboration with Lionsgate.

The deal, worth $100 million, according to a source familiar with the financing, will let Databricks\u2019 over 10,000 customers, such as Comcast, Conde Nast and Block, use Claude to create and deploy AI agents for their businesses.\n\nThe idea is to let companies launch AI bots that can pull from their own data to carry out tasks in specific areas, like detecting financial fraud, developing medicine or assisting with customer service. The deal includes access to Anthropic\u2019s latest AI model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which includes features of a conventional language model, but is also capable of \u201creasoning\u201d through multi-step problems.\n\nThe focus on the enterprise comes directly from Anthropic\u2019s founding principles, said Mike Krieger, Anthropic\u2019s chief product officer. The company was started in 2021 by CEO Dario Amodei and other defectors from OpenAI, aimed at building artificial intelligence with an emphasis on guardrails. \u201cThe purpose and story around the company is being really grounded in responsibility, trust and safety,\u201d Krieger toldForbes.\n\nSince companies already secure some of their most important data with Databricks, they\u2019ll be able to use Claude to retrieve and parse through massive troves of unstructured data safely, which will \u201cmatter a lot to enterprises,\u201d said Krieger, who cofounded Instagram before leaving Meta in 2018. He joined Anthropic last year.\n\nNaveen Rao, vice-president of AI at Databricks, said that one popular use case will likely be building AI coding assistants that companies can use internally, taking advantage of Claude\u2019s programming ability.\n\nAI giants and upstarts alike are increasingly targeting business customers, who need better reliability and security features than typical consumers. Anthropicreportedlyprojects revenue as high as $34.5 billion in two years, with nearly two-thirds of it coming from business users. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Enterprise, a version of the popular bot specifically for corporate customers, has 1 million paid users. Then there are startups like$1.9 billion Writer AI, which makes AI services to automate menial business tasks, and$1.3 billion Clay, makers of AI spreadsheet tools for companies to organize and suss out sales leads.\n\nDatabricks, valued at $62 billion, makes money by renting out tools to other companies for storing, collecting and governing data. The company\u2014backed by Nvidia, Capital One and Andreessen Horowitz\u2014was founded in 2013, but has flown high during the current frenzy over generative AI. Last year, the companylaunched its ownopen source AI model, called DBRX, aimed at letting companies build and deploy their own AI agents. Other models available on Databricks\u2019 platform include Meta\u2019s Llama and Mistral\u2019s open source models.\n\nAs part of the partnership, Krieger and Rao said Anthropic and Databricks may develop new features together. They could also conduct joint research around new ways to deploy and use frontier models. For example, the two companies could figure out ways to make the models better in areas that need extreme accuracy, like accounting or legal services, Rao said.\n\nFor Anthropic, the deal will allow the company to get better at deploying agents because it will have a direct channel of feedback from Databricks customers using the models every day. \u201cThat\u2019s an area where the rubber hits the road,\u201d Krieger said.", "extraction_status": "success"}, {"company": "Databricks", "title": "Anthropic, Databricks Team Up in Scramble for AI Revenue", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/technology/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-databricks-team-up-in-scramble-for-ai-revenue/ar-AA1BHxv7", "source": "The Wall Street Journal", "body": "Anthropic and Databricks struck a five year, $100 million pact to sell artificial intelligence tools to businesses, targeting those seeking to build their own AI agents.", "date": "2025-03-26T13:56:00+00:00", "full_content": "Note: Content could not be properly extracted from this source.

The takeaway: LLMs are even stranger than we thought.\n\nThe Anthropic team was surprised by some of the counterintuitive workarounds that large language models appear to use to complete sentences, solve simple math problems, suppress hallucinations, and more, says Joshua Batson, a research scientist at the company.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that large language modelswork in mysterious ways. Few\u2014if any\u2014mass-market technologies have ever beenso little understood. That makes figuring out what makes them tick one of the biggest open challenges in science.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about curiosity. Shedding some light on how these models work exposes their weaknesses, revealing why theymake stuff upand why they can betricked into going off the rails. It helps resolvedeep disputes about exactly what these models can and can\u2019t do. And it shows how trustworthy (or not) they really are.\n\nBatson and his colleagues describe their new work in two reports published today. The first presents Anthropic\u2019s use of a technique called circuit tracing, which lets researchers track the decision-making processes inside a large language model step by step. Anthropic used circuit tracing to watch its LLM Claude 3.5 Haiku carry out various tasks. The second (titled \u201cOn the Biology of a Large Language Model\u201d) details what the team discovered when it looked at 10 tasks in particular.\n\n\u201cI think this is really cool work,\u201d says Jack Merullo, who studies large language models at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and was not involved in the research. \u201cIt\u2019s a really nice step forward in terms of methods.\u201d\n\nCircuit tracing is not itself new. Last year Merullo and his colleaguesanalyzed a specific circuit in a version of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-2, an older large language model that OpenAI released in 2019. But Anthropic has now analyzed a number of different circuits inside a far larger and far more complex model as it carries out multiple tasks. \u201cAnthropic is very capable at applying scale to a problem,\u201d says Merullo.\n\nEden Biran, who studies large language models at Tel Aviv University, agrees. \u201cFinding circuits in a large state-of-the-art model such as Claude is a nontrivial engineering feat,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it shows that circuits scale up and might be a good way forward for interpreting language models.\u201d\n\nCircuits chain together different parts\u2014or components\u2014of a model. Last year, Anthropicidentified certain components inside Claudethat correspond to real-world concepts. Some were specific, such as \u201cMichael Jordan\u201d or \u201cgreenness\u201d; others were more vague, such as \u201cconflict between individuals.\u201d One component appeared to represent the Golden Gate Bridge. Anthropic researchers found that if they turned up the dial on this component, Claude could be made to self-identify not as a large language model but as the physical bridge itself.\n\nThe latest work builds on that research and the work of others,including Google DeepMind, to reveal some of the connections between individual components. Chains of components are the pathways between the words put into Claude and the words that come out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tip-of-the-iceberg stuff. Maybe we\u2019re looking at a few percent of what\u2019s going on,\u201d says Batson. \u201cBut that\u2019s already enough to see incredible structure.\u201d\n\nResearchers at Anthropic and elsewhere are studying large language models as if they were natural phenomena rather than human-built software. That\u2019s because the models are trained, not programmed.\n\n\u201cThey almost grow organically,\u201d says Batson. \u201cThey start out totally random. Then you train them on all this data and they go from producing gibberish to being able to speak different languages and write software and fold proteins. There are insane things that these models learn to do, but we don\u2019t know how that happened because we didn\u2019t go in there and set the knobs.\u201d\n\nSure, it\u2019s all math. But it\u2019s not math that we can follow. \u201cOpen up a large language model and all you will see is billions of numbers\u2014the parameters,\u201d says Batson. \u201cIt\u2019s not illuminating.\u201d\n\nAnthropic says it was inspired by brain-scan techniques used in neuroscience to build what the firm describes as a kind of microscope that can be pointed at different parts of a model while it runs. The technique highlights components that are active at different times. Researchers can then zoom in on different components and record when they are and are not active.\n\nTake the component that corresponds to the Golden Gate Bridge. It turns on when Claude is shown text that names or describes the bridge or even text related to the bridge, such as \u201cSan Francisco\u201d or \u201cAlcatraz.\u201d It\u2019s off otherwise.\n\nYet another component might correspond to the idea of \u201csmallness\u201d: \u201cWe look through tens of millions of texts and see it\u2019s on for the word \u2018small,\u2019 it\u2019s on for the word \u2018tiny,\u2019 it\u2019s on for the French word \u2018petit,\u2019 it\u2019s on for words related to smallness, things that are itty-bitty, like thimbles\u2014you know, just small stuff,\u201d says Batson.\n\nHaving identified individual components, Anthropic then follows the trail inside the model as different components get chained together. The researchers start at the end, with the component or components that led to the final response Claude gives to a query. Batson and his team then trace that chain backwards.\n\nSo: What did they find? Anthropic looked at 10 different behaviors in Claude. One involved the use of different languages. Does Claude have a part that speaks French and another part that speaks Chinese, and so on?\n\nThe team found that Claude used components independent of any language to answer a question or solve a problem and then picked a specific language when it replied. Ask it \u201cWhat is the opposite of small?\u201d in English, French, and Chinese and Claude will first use the language-neutral components related to \u201csmallness\u201d and \u201copposites\u201dto come up with an answer. Only then will it pick a specific language in which to reply. This suggests that large language models can learn things in one language and apply them in other languages.\n\nAnthropic also looked at how Claude solved simple math problems. The team found that the model seems to have developed its own internal strategies that are unlike those it will have seen in its training data. Ask Claude to add 36 and 59 and the model will go through a series of odd steps, including first adding a selection of approximate values (add 40ish and 60ish, add 57ish and 36ish). Towards the end of its process, it comes up with the value 92ish. Meanwhile, another sequence of steps focuses on the last digits, 6 and 9, and determines that the answer must end in a 5. Putting that together with 92ish gives the correct answer of 95.\n\nAnd yet if you then ask Claude how it worked that out, it will say something like: \u201cI added the ones (6+9=15), carried the 1, then added the 10s (3+5+1=9), resulting in 95.\u201d In other words, it gives you a common approach found everywhere online rather than what it actually did. Yep! LLMs are weird. (And not to be trusted.)\n\nThis is clear evidence that large language models will give reasons for what they do that do not necessarily reflect what they actually did. But this is true for people too, says Batson: \u201cYou ask somebody, \u2018Why did you do that?\u2019 And they\u2019re like, \u2018Um, I guess it\u2019s because I was\u2014 .\u2019 You know, maybe not. Maybe they were just hungry and that\u2019s why they did it.\u201d\n\nBiran thinks this finding is especially interesting. Many researchers study the behavior of large language models by asking them to explain their actions. But that might be a risky approach, he says: \u201cAs models continue getting stronger, they must be equipped with better guardrails. I believe\u2014and this work also shows\u2014that relying only on model outputs is not enough.\u201d\n\nA third task that Anthropic studied was writing poems. The researchers wanted to know if the model really did just wing it, predicting one word at a time. Instead they found that Claude somehow looked ahead, picking the word at the end of the next line several words in advance.\n\nFor example, when Claude was given the prompt \u201cA rhyming couplet: He saw a carrot and had to grab it,\u201d the model responded, \u201cHis hunger was like a starving rabbit.\u201d But using their microscope, they saw that Claude had already hit upon the word \u201crabbit\u201d when it was processing \u201cgrab it.\u201d It then seemed to write the next line with that ending already in place.\n\nThis might sound like a tiny detail. But it goes against the common assumption that large language models always work by picking one word at a time in sequence. \u201cThe planning thing in poems blew me away,\u201d says Batson. \u201cInstead of at the very last minute trying to make the rhyme make sense, it knows where it\u2019s going.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought that was cool,\u201d says Merullo. \u201cOne of the joys of working in the field is moments like that. There\u2019s been maybe small bits of evidence pointing toward the ability of models to plan ahead, but it\u2019s been a big open question to what extent they do.\u201d\n\nAnthropic then confirmed its observation by turning off the placeholder component for \u201crabbitness.\u201d Claude responded with \u201cHis hunger was a powerful habit.\u201d And when the team replaced \u201crabbitness\u201d with \u201cgreenness,\u201dClaude responded with \u201cfreeing it from the garden\u2019s green.\u201d\n\nAnthropic also explored why Claude sometimes made stuff up, a phenomenon known as hallucination. \u201cHallucination is the most natural thing in the world for these models, given how they\u2019re just trained to give possible completions,\u201d says Batson. \u201cThe real question is, \u2018How in God\u2019s name could you ever make it not do that?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe latest generation of large language models, like Claude 3.5 and Gemini and GPT-4o, hallucinate far less than previous versions, thanks to extensive post-training (the steps that take an LLM trained on text scraped from most of the internet and turn it into a usable chatbot). But Batson\u2019s team was surprised to find that this post-training seems to have made Claude refuse to speculate as a default behavior. When it did respond with false information, it was because some other component had overridden the \u201cdon\u2019t speculate\u201d component.\n\nThis seemed to happen most often when the speculation involved a celebrity or other well-known entity. It\u2019s as if the amount of information available on a subject pushed the speculation through, despite the default setting. When Anthropic overrode the \u201cdon\u2019t speculate\u201d component to test this, Claude produced lots of false statements about individuals, including claiming that Batson was famous for inventing the Batson principle (he isn\u2019t).\n\nBecause we know so little about large language models, any new insight is a big step forward. \u201cA deep understanding of how these models work under the hood would allow us to design and train models that are much better and stronger,\u201d says Biran.\n\nBut Batson notes there are still serious limitations. \u201cIt\u2019s a misconception that we\u2019ve found all the components of the model or, like, a God\u2019s-eye view,\u201d he says. \u201cSome things are in focus, but other things are still unclear\u2014a distortion of the microscope.\u201d\n\nAnd it takes several hours for a human researcher to trace the responses to even very short prompts. What\u2019s more, these models can do a remarkable number of different things, and Anthropic has so far looked at only 10 of them.\n\nBatson also says there are big questions that this approach won\u2019t answer. Circuit tracing can be used to peer at the structures inside a large language model, but it won\u2019t tell you how or why those structures formed during training. \u201cThat\u2019s a profound question that we don\u2019t address at all in this work,\u201d he says.\n\nBut Batson does see this as the start of a new era in which it is possible, at last, to find real evidence for how these models work: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be, like: \u2018Are they thinking? Are they reasoning? Are they dreaming? Are they memorizing?\u2019 Those are all analogies. But if we can literally see step by step what a model is doing, maybe now we don\u2019t need analogies.\u201d\n\nThe new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload\u2014but it\u2019s highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers.\n\nThese newer models appear more likely to indulge in rule-bending behaviors than previous generations\u2014and there\u2019s no way to stop them.\n\nWe\u2019re starting to get a better sense of how chatbots are affecting us\u2014but there\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know.\n\nThe country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.\n\nDiscover special offers, top stories,\n            upcoming events, and more.", "extraction_status": "success"}, {"company": "xAI", "title": "Week in Review: Elon Musk's xAI buys X", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/29/week-in-review-elon-musks-xai-buys-x/", "source": "TechCrunch", "body": "Welcome back to Week in Review!

This combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. \u201cToday, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent,\u201d Musk said.\n\nFudging the numbers:More than 20 sources \u2014 including investors and current and former employees \u2014 told TechCrunch that a16z- and Benchmark-backed 11xhas experienced financial struggles, largely of its own making. \u201cThey absolutely massaged the numbers internally when it came to growth and churn,\u201d a former employee said.\n\nBlock layoffs:A leaked message by Block CEO Jack Dorsey reviewed by TechCrunch revealed that the company \u2014 which owns Cash App and Square \u2014was laying off 931 people, or 8% of the company, as part of an \u201corg restructuring.\u201dDorsey\u2019s email denies that the layoffs are for financial reasons or to replace workers with AI.\n\nThis is TechCrunch\u2019s Week in Review, where we recap the week\u2019s biggest news.

The pardon comes just a few weeks after Nikola filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nSpeaking of leaks:A leaked database seen by TechCrunch shows that China has developed anAI system that supercharges its already formidable censorship machine, extending far beyond traditional taboos like the Tiananmen Square massacre.\n\nSkunkworks spins out:Rivian\u2019s skunkworks project wasspun out of the companywith a new name and $105 million in funding from Eclipse Ventures. The startup, called Also, will exist as a stand-alone company from Rivian.\n\nGet your computers ready:Apple announced thatWorldwide Developers Conference 2025 will begin June 9.

The company\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Anne Wojcicki, separately said she is leaving to become an independent bidder for the company.Your data might not be safe, sohere are some ways to delete it.\n\nAn act of Congress:Kat Abughazaleh, the 26-year-old who was among the people laid off from Media Matters after Elon Musk sued the company,announced this week that she\u2019s running for Congress. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be really transparent about how to run for office, because I feel like it\u2019s kind of this black hole that seems a lot more difficult than it should be,\u201d she told TechCrunch.\n\nA slice of \u201cSeverance\u201d:I haven\u2019t watched any seasons of \u201cSeverance,\u201d and based on seemingly everyone in the world, I\u2019m absolutely missing out.

While the debate over whether this is horrifying (Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki once said that \u201cAI is an insult to life itself\u201d) or cool, it does highlight one thing:Copyrights are still a concernwhen it comes to AI-generated anything. Although copying the art style isn\u2019t necessarily unlawful, OpenAI training its models on Studio Ghibli\u2019s art operates in a legal \u201cgray area.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this raises the same question that we\u2019ve been asking ourselves for a couple years now,\u201d Evan Brown, an intellectual property lawyer, told TechCrunch. \u201cWhat are the copyright infringement implications of going out, crawling the web, and copying into these databases?\u201d\n\nTopics\n\nDeputy Managing Editor\n\nKaryne Levy is the deputy managing editor of TechCrunch.

(TSLA,Financials) shares fell 3.5% Friday and extended losses by another 6% in premarket trading Monday after CEO Elon Musk said his artificial intelligence companyxAI acquired social media platform Xin an all-stock transaction.\n\nMusk said the deal assigns xAI a valuation of $80 billion and X $33 billion, based on $45 billion in equity minus $12 billion in debt. He posted the announcement on X, formerly known as Twitter, which he acquired in October 2022 for $44 billion.\n\nThe acquisition formalizes ongoing integration between the two companies. xAI's Grok chatbot, trained on user content from X, already operates on the platform and became available as a standalone iOS app in January 2025.\n\nMusk said the deal will consolidate both firms' data, compute infrastructure, model development, user reach and personnel. He described the merger as a step toward delivering more intelligent user experiences and promoting xAI's broader mission to seek truth and advance knowledge.\n\nFounded in 2023, xAI raised $5 billion in recent funding, which valued the company at $50 billion. Musk previously said he would bring a proposal to Tesla's board of directors for a $5 billion investment in xAI following a favorable result from an online poll. Tesla has not issued a statement on the proposal.\n\nX had reportedly been seeking to raise capital at a $44 billion valuation prior to the acquisition. Musk did not say how the transaction might affect that effort.\n\nThis article first appeared onGuruFocus.", "extraction_status": "success"}, {"company": "Revolut", "title": "Two women avoid jail for their role in Revolut scam that saw doctor lose \u20ac11,000", "url": "https://extra.ie/2025/03/31/news/courts/women-avoid-jail-revolut-scam", "source": "Extra.ie", "body": "Two women in their 20s have been given suspended sentences for their part in a Revolut scam, which saw a doctor lose \u20ac11,000.", "date": "2025-03-31T17:46:00+00:00", "full_content": "Two women in their 20s have been given suspended sentences for their part in a Revolut scam, which saw a doctor lose \u20ac11,000.\n\nCourtney Fitzpatrick (26) of Yeats Avenue, Kincora Park in Limerick, and Leah York (22) of Ashfield, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, were beforeDublin Circuit Criminal Court,where they pleaded guilty to money laundering on September 3, 2023, by possessing the proceeds of crime.\n\nDetective Garda John Sheedy told the court that a doctor received a call that afternoon from an unknown person purporting to be an agent fromRevolut.\n\nThe caller told her that her account had been compromised, and requested access to her app. He told her that her account and card had been frozen.\n\nA number of transactions were then carried out on her account, with \u20ac5,500 being transferred to York\u2019s account and \u20ac5,500 to Fitzpatrick\u2019s account. The money was subsequently transferred into a cryptocurrency account.\n\nThe women were identified and interviewed by garda\u00ed. Neither wished to name the man who was using their account numbers, and Gda Sheedy accepted that this was due to fear. He also said the women had co-operated with the investigation.\n\nFitzpatrick\u2019s counsel said that she had not had an easy life, and would present as vulnerable and naive.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019d want to be very, very naive to allow your account to be used by a third party and not know there was something illicit going on,\u201d remarked the judge.\n\n\u201cThese two young ladies co-operated with somebody who has made a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat these criminals needed were bank accounts to launder the money.\u201d\n\nHe said they had given their details and allowed these people to get away Scot-free.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather tiring dealing with stupid young people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were stupid.

With its extremely useful drag-and-drop features and wide template bank, it turns out to be an easy-to-access platform for anyone to create graphics that would look professionally made. While the free plan works perfectly well for some rather simple designs, most users soon tend to hit upon walls, as is the case with most free plan users. Using Canva Pro is the next most obvious step because it unlocks an array of powerful tools aimed at boosting productivity, making work easier, and resulting in better creative output.\n\nThe free version of Canva offers a good starting point, but it comes with plenty of limitations that would disappoint someone looking for a more professional creative tool. Premium content access is restricted, the free edition has very few templates, stock images, or design elements, which can be extremely limiting for those who need business-quality images made without looking for alternatives.\n\nFree membership storage limitations:Free members have a quota of only 5GB for cloud storage, which can make managing lots of projects or high-resolution materials quite impractical very quickly.\n\nBasic design tools:Important features likeBackground Removerand Magical Resize have been excluded from the free package, leaving users without the ability to quickly and easily set up a time-efficient workflow across different materials.\n\nThe upgrade to Canva Pro allows the user to access and enjoy many features that could help in enhancing creativity and making work more efficient by saving time.Large content collection:Offersunlimited accessto over 100 million well-stocked photos, videos, audio tracks, and graphics for better creative possibilities.Advanced editing options:The capability to remove the background through AI and theMagic Resize optionmakes them easily adjusted to different platforms.Brand kit management:Up to 1,000 brand kit designs available to pro members for maintaining brand consistency using logos, fonts, and colours.Improved storage and organisation:1 terabyte of cloud storage organises sophisticated design assets and allows users to keep projects organised.Cooperative features:The real-time collaboration makes work easy within teams and much simpler to manage workflow reducing stress at times of collaboration.\n\nFor those who want more from their freeCanva subscription, Canva Pro is unquestionably a fantastic choice. The extra features it offers would make the designing process easy and professional. The Payoff is Pronto for individuals and teams looking for crisp work to have this resource. The payoff is even much more worth it for businesses and content creators wanting formalised and consistent branding or visual excellence-more so the access to a content library of incredible size, complex design capabilities, andstreamlined collaboration features.", "extraction_status": "success"}, {"company": "Canva", "title": "Adobe Alternatives That Could Save You Money and Time", "url": "https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/adobe-creative-cloud-alternatives/", "source": "Geeky Gadgets", "body": "Is Adobe still the king of design? Compare top alternatives like Canva, Figma, and Affinity to find the best tool for your creative needs.", "date": "2025-03-31T19:15:00+00:00", "full_content": "Adobe has long been regarded as the leader in design software, largely due to its powerful Creative Cloud suite. Its dominance is rooted in its advanced features, seamless integration across tools, and widespread adoption by professionals in various industries. However, the design landscape is evolving. Competitors such as Canva, Affinity Suite, CorelDRAW, and Figma are challenging Adobe\u2019s supremacy by offering specialized, cost-effective solutions tailored to specific needs. This guide by Bring Your Own Laptop\u00a0examines Adobe\u2019s position in the market and evaluates how these alternatives stack up, helping you determine which tool aligns best with your creative goals.\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways :\n\nAdobe Photoshop has become synonymous with professional photo editing, offering robust tools for compositing, retouching, and AI-powered enhancements. Its versatility and depth make it indispensable for photographers, graphic designers, and digital artists. However, emerging competitors like Canva and Affinity Photo are carving out niches by addressing specific user needs.\n\nVerdict:Photoshop remains the top choice for professionals who require advanced tools and precision. Canva and Affinity Photo, on the other hand, are excellent alternatives for casual users or those working on less complex projects.\n\nAdobe Illustrator is widely recognized as the industry standard for vector graphics and typography. Its precision tools and prepress capabilities make it indispensable for creating logos, illustrations, and print-ready designs. However, alternatives like Affinity Designer, CorelDRAW, and Figma offer compelling options for specific use cases.\n\nVerdict:Illustrator remains unmatched for intricate vector work and professional-grade typography. Affinity Designer and CorelDRAW are strong alternatives for specific needs, while Figma excels in UX/UI design.\n\nWatch this video on YouTube.\n\nBelow are more guides on AI images from our extensive range of articles.\n\nAdobe InDesign continues to dominate the desktop publishing space, offering advanced tools for typography, automation, and handling large documents. Its ability to manage complex layouts and integrate seamlessly with other Adobe tools makes it the preferred choice for professional publishers. However, alternatives like Affinity Publisher and QuarkXPress cater to niche audiences and provide viable options for simpler projects.\n\nVerdict:InDesign remains the gold standard for professional publishing, particularly for large-scale and complex projects. Affinity Publisher is a cost-effective alternative for simpler tasks, while QuarkXPress struggles to maintain relevance.\n\nAdobe Express and Canva are both designed for casual creators, offering easy-to-use tools for creating social media graphics, quick designs, and other lightweight projects. These platforms prioritize accessibility and affordability, making them popular choices for non-professional users.\n\nVerdict:Canva remains the preferred choice for most casual users due to its ease of use and popularity. Adobe Express is a strong alternative for those already invested in Adobe\u2019s ecosystem or seeking additional AI-driven features.\n\nFigma\u2019s superior collaboration features and intuitive interface have made it the go-to tool for UX/UI designers.\n\nVerdict:With Adobe stepping back from the UX/UI market, Figma stands unchallenged as the leader in this space.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud offers a comprehensive suite of professional-grade tools, making it a versatile choice for designers across industries. Its seamless interoperability allows users to transition between applications effortlessly, enhancing productivity and workflow efficiency. However, its subscription-based pricing model can be a significant barrier for casual users or small businesses.\n\nVerdict:Creative Cloud is invaluable for professionals managing diverse, complex projects. For casual users or those with simpler needs, more affordable and straightforward solutions may be a better fit.\n\nMedia Credit:Bring Your Own Laptop\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets DealsDisclosure:Some of our articles include affiliate links.
