It also looks more like a digital watch than a medical alert device.FEATURED PARTNER OFFERWe receive compensation from our partners for Featured Partner Offer placements.

She retired after selling two other companies she founded, but she was inspired to rejoin the workforce to address problems faced by her mother, who was active but frail and wanted to age in place safely.\n\n\u201c[S]ome of the best stuff I think gets created because of the need, and needs are just not being met in silver tech,\u201d says Booth, noting that none of themedical alert systemsavailable in 2013 would have worked for her mother (theApple Watchdidn\u2019t hit store shelves until April 2015). \u201cThependantis super stigmatizing. And the problem is even with a pendant, you take it off at night because of the threat of choking. Yet the number one cause of injury among older adults is falls\u2014mostly in the bathroom and mostly at night,\u201d explains Booth. \u201cWe realized we could build a watch that you could wear 24/7.\u201d\n\nThe UnaliWear Kanega Watch is disguised discreetly as a digital wristwatch to avoid the potential stigma of wearing a medical alert device. It can interact with the wearer via voice, a push button and large white-on-black text on its screen. The watch is water-resistant, so users can wear it in the shower, although it\u2019s not recommended for swimming. The watch comes with four rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which can be swapped in and out without taking off the watch.\n\nWhen users first receive the watch, they provide UnaliWear with any relevant medical information.\n\nThe watch connects to the internet and an emergency response operator via Wi-Fi and runs exclusively on the Verizon 4G/5G cellular network nationwide. If an emergency occurs, (the user falls or calls for help), the watch\u2019sGPScan help locate them. It also connects them to an emergency response operator in seconds.\n\nUnaliWear\u2019s emergency response center is a U.S.-based, third-party provider that\u2019s Five Diamond certified by TMA, the monitoring industry\u2019s highest standard. The operators have each customer\u2019s provided medical information on hand to help determine what kind of help should be sent when they receive a call.\n\nTo start talking to the Kanega Watch, say, \u201cFred Astaire,\u201d and give it a command.\n\nSince no two people share identical falling patterns, the watch uses artificial intelligence (AI) to learn about each user\u2019s movements. If the watch detects what might be a fall and the wearer tells the alert center that they didn\u2019t fall, the AI learns to ignore similar movements of that user in the future.\n\nThe watch face includes a black screen with white text and comes in three accent colors: rose gold, champagne gold and black. Each watch strap is black no matter the accent color selected.\n\nUnaliWear offers two monitoring subscription options for the Kanega Watch: the annual plan and the monthly plan.\n\nFor the annual plan, users pay for device setup and 12 months of service upfront. Costs include a $199 one-time setup fee and$59.95 per month for ongoing monitoring and service. The total upfront cost is $918.40.\n\nFor the monthly plan, users pay for device setup and the first month of service upfront.

This is the second patent in DERMALA's intellectual property portfolio that covers using the human microbiome to treat and prevent acne.\n\nAcneisthe most common skin condition that affectsover\u00a080% of adolescents. It often persists into adulthood with a negative impact on the quality of life. Acne vulgaris is characterized by microbiome dysbiosis associated with an overgrowth ofC. acnesbacteria, followed by inflammation of skin follicles. To date, many strategies have been used to treat acne. However, they often show limited efficacy accompanied by side effects, in part due to suboptimal delivery into the skin and lack of targeting.\n\nDERMALA developed a novel technology for enhanced targeted delivery of human microbiome-derived postbiotic metabolites into specific layers of the skin. This results in higher treatment efficacy due to targeted inhibition ofC. acnesin follicles and reducing inflammation while avoiding side effects.\u00a0The microbiome-derived postbiotics derived from beneficial bacteria help correct the microbiome dysbiosis associated with acne and produce faster and longer-lasting results.\n\n\"Targeted delivery is critical\u00a0for\u00a0overcoming side effects and achieving high treatment efficacy,\" said Dr. Lada Rasochova, founder and CEO of DERMALA. \"Granting of this patent recognizes the uniqueness of our delivery approach and further enhances the value of our microbiome technology as it allows for formulating microbiome-derived ingredients into specific, efficacious, and effective topical products\".\n\nThis patent is an important part of the fast-expanding DERMALA's intellectual property portfolio which focuses on using the human microbiome for improving skin health and treating skin conditions like acne and eczema.\n\nAbout DERMALADERMALA, Inc. is aSan Diego-based consumer dermatology company leveraging a scientific understanding of the human microbiome and data analytics to develop novel treatments for chronic skin conditions.

By being able to visualize one\u2019s heart rate and breathing, users can learn to regulate their nervous system. The company has gone through several clinical trials, received a grant from the National Institutes of Health and also participated in Y Combinator.\n\nDuring COVID-19, Flowly saw an influx in providers interested in its product\u2014for use on themselves, co-founder and CEO Celine Tien told Fierce Healthcare. They were also eager to receive information about innovative ways to use pain management and anxiety therapies. \u201cThe problem with our healthcare model today is that so many providers live in their own silos,\u201d Tien said.\n\nTo help bridge gaps in knowledge, Flowly created a founding board of physicians, with 15 active members, where they share creative ways of using Flowly in practice. Members of the board also get access to the latest research, data and features from Flowly and can offer feedback to improve the product. Some members also work with Flowly to design lectures on their domain expertise. Nearly all members of the board have used Flowly themselves, Tien said.\n\nJaimee Arnoff, Ph.D., a licensed clinical psychologist specializing in young adults, initially heard about Flowly on a podcast.

It\u2019s essentially a self-contained RSS reader that\u2019s full of the best Android news sites, enabling you to keep up to date about all things Android. We\u2019re included in the list of news sources, as are Android Central, Android Police and the XDA Portal. It\u2019s a tablet-optimized app as well, making it perfect for those times when all you want to do is read about Android in leisure on that nice big Galaxy Note 12.2 you\u2019re waiting custom ROMs to appear on. With a night theme, and more available in the Pro version, Flowly is an essential app to keep on top of news if you\u2019re an Android enthusiast. The question is of course, how good an app is Flowly?\n\nHow it Works:After a quick download fromthe Play Store\u2013 of which there\u2019s also aPro versionwith added features \u2013\u00a0you\u2019re able to start using Flowly as you would any other app.\n\nAfter taking a look at what\u2019s new with the app, you\u2019re sent straight to the list of Android news on tap. With sites on the left and all the newest news on the right-hand side of the display.\n\nThe app can be used in portrait as well, and looks particularly nice on KitKat devices in its dark night theme.\n\nThere\u2019s a YouTube portal as well, which easily gets you to the channels of all the included Android sites. Which is great for when new devices comes out and you want to drool over some unboxings.\n\nOpinion:Flowly, is a great app for those that are looking to get hold of Android news and content. After all, that is the app\u2019s sole purpose and it fulfills that brilliantly. It looks great on tablets and the whole app is nice and smooth. The Pro version is well worth looking into as well, as it has a number of added features and isn\u2019t all that expensive. Where or not Flowly is an app for you depends on how interested in Android you are, if you\u2019re a die-hard fan then you need to install this app. For keeping abreast of all the most important Android news out there, Flowly is the app to go with. Sure, you could create a an RSS feed with all of your favorite Android sites, but that takes time and not everyone has the patience for that. Apps like Appy Geek are good alternatives, but again they\u2019re not as focused and can feel cluttered.\n\nRatings\n\nPros\n\nCons\n\nConclusion:Flowly is one of those apps that any Android enthusiast really ought to have installed. It\u2019s certainly not perfect, but it fulfills what it sets out to do very well and there are no glaring issues with the app. Sure, on the surface it\u2019s just an RSS app full of Android feeds. What if that\u2019s all you really need though? It\u2019s a very efficient way of grouping all of this news together and the developer also manages to avoid bias, too. While it would be nice to be able to add custom feeds in the app, I can understand why it\u2019s not included right now and someone like myself can certainly see the appeal of some quality curation such as this. Flowly is a good app for those that are heavily involved in Android.", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Rosy Wellness", "title": "Dar\u00e9 Bioscience and Rosy Wellness Announce Strategic Collaboration to ...", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dar-bioscience-rosy-wellness-announce-120000637.html", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "body": "Collaboration will leverage Rosy Wellness' extensive reach and community of over 250,000 women Rosy Wellness is a multi-award winning app recommended by 8,000+ healthcare professionals Dar\u00e9 ...", "date": "2025-06-04", "full_content": "Collaboration will leverage Rosy Wellness\u2019 extensive reach and community of over 250,000 women\n\nRosy Wellness is a multi-award winning app recommended by 8,000+ healthcare professionals\n\nDar\u00e9 expects to start recording revenue in the 4th quarter this year\n\nSAN DIEGO, June 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dar\u00e9\u00a0Bioscience, Inc.

(KFSN) --The simple act of walking can be challenging for those living with Parkinson's disease, which affects movement.\n\nHowever, a Clovis veteran is now on the move with the help of a newly-invented device.\n\n\"It feels like your feet are stuck in cement,\" explained Patrick Hallmark. \"A lot of people who have Parkinson's, you'd be going through a doorway or whatever, and your feet -- you just cannot move your feet.\"\n\nThe 63-year-old has a condition called \"Freezing of Gait,\" which can come with Parkinson's.\n\nIt can lead to falls and hospitalizations.\n\nFor Hallmark, it also came with a loss of independence.\n\n\"If I didn't have my wife or daughter with me, I would really have a hard time out going to stores and everything,\" he said.\n\nThat's all changed with a device as small as his palm.\n\n\"This has done wonders,\" Hallmark said, as he shows his NexStride device.\n\nThrough a Parkinson's support group, Hallmark learned about NexStride and immediately bought the device.\n\nNow he's walking, despite his condition.\n\nSidney Collin, CEO of De Oro Devices, explained why walking can be hard for people with Freezing of Gait.\n\n\"There's a disconnect between the brain and the body, and it makes it so that when the brain is sending that signal to initiate movement, it doesn't get to the motor neurons that are activating the muscles,\" she said.\n\nCollin, a biomedical engineer, created NexStride for a veteran while she was in college.\n\nThe device essentially uses the same visual and auditory signals or cues used in physical therapy.\n\n\"The visual cue that we use is a green laser line projected onto the floor in front of you. The auditory cue is a metronome,\" she explained. \"So you visualize yourself stepping over that green laser line, stepping to the beat of the metronome. Just by changing the intention behind the movement, by setting that goal, we're changing the part of the brain that's been activated, that allows someone to be able to restore mobility.\"\n\nCollin is happy to see NexStride restoring mobility for people like Hallmark.\n\n\"I am able to walk or take my dog for walks,\" Hallmark said. \"I'm able to get out and go shopping, grocery shopping for my wife -- just do different things like that.\"\n\nThe device is $499 and it's 100% covered for veterans through Veterans Affairs, as well as the Parkinson's Wellness Fund organization.", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Partum Health", "title": "INVEST Pitch Perfect Spotlight: How Partum Health Is Working To ...", "url": "https://medcitynews.com/2023/06/maternal-healthcare-postpartum-birth-fertility/", "source": "MedCity News", "body": "Partum Health, a maternal health startup, recently won the consumer/employer track of the MedCity News INVEST Pitch Perfect contest.

It was during this time that she realized how confusing maternal healthcare really is.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the things I was talking to my clients about \u2014 like the digital front door and how we build around patient-centered outcomes and multidisciplinary care models \u2014 were really absent when it came to my maternal care journey,\u201d Doyle said in an interview. \u201cThat made a big impression on me.\u201d\n\nBreak down the silos. Take control of your provider data.\n\nWhat was absent was care for needs other than actual pregnancy care, like mental health and physical therapy. Postpartum care was also seriously lacking. Drawing from her experience, Doyle went on to create Chicago-basedPartum Healthin 2020.Judges crowned Partum Health the winner of the consumer/employer track of theMedCity News INVEST Pitch Perfect conteston May 24, preferring it over four other companies.\n\nPartum Health, a direct-to-consumer company, supports families during fertility, pregnancy and postpartum. It currently only serves patients in Illinois, but is looking to expand nationally. It offers doula care (during birth and postpartum), lactation consultants, physical therapy, nutrition support, mental health services and acupuncture. Patients can meet with the care team in the provider\u2019s office, the patient\u2019s home or via telehealth. They can also chat with the care team through Partum\u2019s app.\n\n\u201cI think the reality is, if you want to have a great postpartum experience, you actually have to start planning and doing preventative care during your pregnancy,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cThen we also know that, for example, when people are in the midst of fertility treatments, there\u2019s a really high incidence of mental health challenges, and also nothing really built into that care delivery to bring mental health side-by-side with your fertility journey. There may also be instances where people need support with the physical side from [physical therapy], things like nutrition, that can really aid in supporting optimal fertility, pregnancy and postpartum.\u201d\n\nPartum Health was chosen as the winner of the Pitch Perfect contest because it is filling an \u201cunmet market need,\u201d said Shawn Ellis, managing partner ofDistributed Venturesand a judge for the contest.\n\nHealthcare is drowning in chaos\u2014from scattered data to burnout-inducing tasks. Discover how smarter workflows and real-time insights can rescue care teams and transform patient outcomes.\n\n\u201cThere was a consensus that Partum is coordination of different specialist care that\u2019s really, really needed during pregnancy and post pregnancy,\u201d Ellis said. \u201c[I] loved the coordination of care, loved the very consumer-centric approach, patient-centric approach.\u201d\n\nWhile Partum is a direct-to-consumer company, it is in-network with Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Cigna for its clinical services. It functions in a fee-for-service model, in which clinical care is usually reimbursed through insurance and non-clinical services like doula care is paid out of pocket or through a health savings account or flexible spending account.Down the line, the company aims to engage in more payer relationships (including Medicaid), as well as work with employers.\n\nPartum has received interest from investors as well, raising a little over $1 million in a pre-seed round from angel investors. The startup is currently raising\u00a0its seed round.\n\nOther maternal health companies are gaining funding as well. Maven Clinic raised$90 millionin Series E funding in November. The company offers care including fertility, maternity and pediatric support. Oula \u2014 which provides midwifery, obstetrics and pregnancy education \u2014 raised more than$19 millionin January.\n\nPartum Health\u2019s ultimate goal is to expand the scope of what\u2019s considered needed in pregnancy care, Doyle said.\n\n\u201cOur aim is that every family \u2014 just like you see an obstetrician or you see a reproductive endocrinologist if you\u2019re going through fertility \u2014 they also have access to mental health and physical therapy and doula care,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the shift that we\u2019re trying to create. The default model really needs to be expanded to include these specialists because that\u2019s what the families are looking for. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to move the needle on the health complications and issues that people are experiencing today.\u201d\n\nPhoto: MedCity News", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Partum Health", "title": "Partum Health Expands to Dallas, On A Mission to Elevate Maternal Care ...", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/partum-health-expands-dallas-mission-124100615.html", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "body": "Partum Health, the Chicago-based maternal health startup that offers direct-to-consumer interdisciplinary pregnancy and postpartum care, is expanding to Dallas, the brand's third market.", "date": "2024-08-21", "full_content": "The maternal health start-up provides expert support for growing families through proactive care from pre-conception through early parenthood.\n\nCHICAGO,Aug. 21, 2024/PRNewswire/ --Partum Health, theChicago-based maternal health startup that offers direct-to-consumer interdisciplinary pregnancy and postpartum care, is expanding toDallas, the brand's third market. Partum was founded inChicagoin 2021 and expanded toHoustoninNovember 2023afterraising$3.1 millionin seed funding.\n\nInthe United States, more women die each year of pregnancy-related complications than in any other developed country, with the majority of those deaths happening between one week and one year of giving birth. And inTexas, the need is especially acute. A2022 studypublished by the Texas Medical Association ranked the state 50th among all states in access to high-quality prenatal and maternal care, citing barriers to health care before and after their hospital stay as a key factor. Moreover, areportlast year by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission found that 90% of the state's pregnancy-related deaths are preventable, recommending an improvement in care coordination and access to comprehensive health services to achieve better outcomes.\n\nPartum Health was founded with a mission to change the standard of maternal care after its founders witnessed the huge gap between the care they needed and what they actually received during their own families' perinatal experiences.\n\nIn addition to a comprehensive network of postpartum specialty providers across lactation, mental health, physical therapy and more, Partum families also have a dedicated care coordinator. This go-to contact helps parents make informed decisions, schedule appointments, navigate insurance and is available 24/7 via text. To help remove barriers to access, Partum's services are available virtually and in-home to meet the dynamic needs of modern families.\n\n\"We built Partum to help bridge the gap in comprehensive maternal health and improve outcomes during the critical postpartum period. Our offerings are focused on preventing the most common complications of pregnancy, including perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and avoidable C-sections, among others. We look forward to partnering with OBs and Midwives acrossDallas/Fort Worthto provide wraparound, interdisciplinary care to their patients,\" saidMeghan Doyle, co-founder and CEO of Partum Health.\n\nTo support its launch inDallas, Partum is hosting gatherings to engage local communities around women's health.Collaborative Care in Women's Healthwill bring together women's health providers across the spectrum of care to discuss how to better integrate in service of improved patient outcomes.Reconnecting and Finding Intimacywill convene experts for an honest discussion on social and emotional wellbeing postpartum. Partum will also be meeting with local expectant families at the Prego Expo Convention.\n\nAbout Partum Health\n\nPartum Health believes all families deserve comprehensive, whole-person care that supports their mental, physical and emotional health needs throughout the pregnancy and postpartum experience. Through digital care coordination and patient education as well as interdisciplinary services offered virtually and in person by expert care providers, Partum Health makes this a reality for families.

Jiminy's 2022. Carlson tells the story of Lauren, a millennial Jiminy's customer who refers to her dog Mordecai as \"her son.\"", "date": "2022-11-07", "full_content": "ByDavid Riemer,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nAnne Carlson, founder and CEO ofJiminy\u2019s, was two years into building her new, sustainable pet food company, before she was able to tell the story of why she created it. It turns out that the story was too emotional for Carlson to share in public. It was a classic \u201cpurpose story\u201d that began with an upsetting conversation Carlson had with her adult daughter about the future of our planet. The conversation was the \u201cinciting incident\u201d in her story that led the former Del Monte executive to tackle climate change by identifying new sources of protein for pet food\u2014starting with crickets. Since creating the company, Carlson and her team have raised $6 million in seed money, secured distribution in 1,100 Petco stores, built a direct-to-consumers business and generated millions in annual revenue. Now, as Carlson looks to raise a Series A to help dramatically scale the business, she has a new storytelling challenge.\n\nJiminy's CEO, Anne Carlson with her dogs Tuco (below) and Timber (above).\n\nBut this startup story starts with Carlson\u2019s origin story.\n\nWhile at Del Monte, Carlson helped aggregate and sell its pet food assets and rebrand them as Big Heart Pet Brands. In 2016, the J.M. Smucker Company bought the new pet brand, and Carlson moved on to think about her next thing. Around this time, Carlson had a conversation that most parents eventually have with their adult children about whether they hope to have kids one day. Carlson\u2019s daughter answered, \u201cno.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t want to bring them into a world that was devolving due to climate change. Carlson was heartbroken. She wished her daughter would experience the same joy she had raising a family. And she might have felt a bit guilty as well about not doing enough to change the narrative. Looking back, Carlson says, \u201cI realized that I couldn\u2019t just do a normal job after that\u2014building a better future for her was everything.\u201d\n\nBecause of Carlson\u2019s experience in the pet food business, she knew thatan estimated 25%-35%of domestic meat production was used to feed dogs and cats. Dogs alone consume 32 billion pounds of protein annually. The environmental impact of feeding pets in the U.S. is huge, because of the massive amount of land, water and feed required to raise cows and chickens. In researching alternatives, Carlson discovered that insects, especially crickets, are a tremendous source of protein that require a fraction of the resources required to produce traditional meat products. Cricket production, by example, generates 99% lessgreenhouse gasthan chicken production. Jiminy\u2019s was created to address this macro problem. In Carlson\u2019s early pitches, she focused on this big picture story.\n\nBut this is where things get more complicated and the real storytelling challenge emerges. The story that inspired Carlson to start the company is a memorable way to introduce Jiminy\u2019s, but to raise a series A, she must also convince investors that there\u2019s a massive market of pet owners willing to feed their dogs insect-based food. This is a common challenge for the founder who has a great origin story for their business. They\u2019ve told ustheirstory, but they\u2019ve yet to introduce the true protagonist in their product story. There has to be acustomerwith a set of needs that only Jiminy\u2019s can solve.\n\nThe good news for Carlson is that millennial and Gen Z pet owners are extraordinarily conscious of \u2014 and troubled by \u2014 the causes of climate change; and they\u2019re knowledgeable about emerging solutions. They also make-up nearly half the dog ownership in the U.S. Now Carlson has the protagonist for her new story.\n\nJiminy's Chewy Cricket Treat\n\nCarlson tells the story of Lauren, a millennial Jiminy\u2019s customer who refers to her dog Mordecai as \u201cher son.\u201d Lauren, like Carlson\u2019s daughter, is extremely worried about climate change so much so that she uses the \u201cgreener\u201d peer-to-peer videoconferencing solutionCrewdleinstead of Zoom for her work and non-profit board meetings. That\u2019s the big picture stuff. But when it comes to Mordecai, an adorable deaf rescue pup, Lauren\u2019s concerned about her dog\u2019s gut health. Mordecai isn\u2019t a lot of fun to be around, when suffering from stomach ailments. Lauren also wants meal options she can provide her pet throughout the day. Custom meal services are expensive and have way too much packaging. She\u2019d be delighted to try a more sustainable pet food, if it was healthy for the dog and came in different formats. Lauren\u2019s heard that insects are an emerging source of protein and she\u2019s willing to try something new.\n\nJiminy's expanding line-up of insect-based pet food.\n\nJiminy\u2019s answers the call. Jiminy\u2019s is asustainable pet foodusing insect protein. Once a customer like Lauren switches from a traditional meat-based pet food to Jiminy\u2019s, for example, it could save 200,000 to 2,000,000 gallons of water every year depending on the size of the dog and whether it had been eating chicken or beef based food (Jiminy\u2019s offers aneco-calculatorto figure this out). The food is nutritious, prebiotic and hypoallergenic. It includes fiber, iron, vitamin B2 and 12. And finally, Jiminy\u2019s offers a host of products from wet food to treats that can feed a dog throughout the day.\n\nFor her roadshow, Carlson will lead with her emotional origin story and quickly pivot to Lauren\u2019s story. Prospective investors will learn why Carlson is so passionate about creating a new pet brand to fight climate change, and why customers like Lauren are buying it. Lauren says, \u201csince switching (brands), Mordecai is a whole new dog. He's healthier, his fur is softer, his breath is better, and we can now breathe around him!\u201d And Lauren also feels like she\u2019s doing her part for the planet. It\u2019s a powerful one-two punch that Carlson hopes will help her raise an $8 million series A to expand her business and promote a healthier future one dog at a time.", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Jiminy's", "title": "Don't Like Eating Insects?

But, being a dog \u2014 with a voracious appetite and no discernible appreciation for narrative tension \u2014 he devoured them immediately. He didn\u2019t know, or care, that they were chock-full of dried crickets and ground-up grubs.\n\nAnd so what I had envisioned as a climactic taste test was over in seconds, with what was, in retrospect, an utterly predictable result: my dog would happily eat insects.\n\nFor years, some enterprising food entrepreneurs have been trying to convince people to do the same.As the global demand for protein grows, insects, they say, provide a more sustainable, ethical alternative to traditional meat. But the idea has been a tough sell. Although insects are a dietary staple in some cultures, for many people, they trigger a visceral disgust response.\n\nBut dogs? If they have a disgust reflex, I haven\u2019t seen it. Insect entrepreneurs looking for open-minded eaters could hardly do better than good old Canis lupus familiaris.\n\n\u201cThe dogs are not going to overthink it,\u201d said Anne Carlson, the chief executive of Jiminy\u2019s, which makes insect-based pet food and treats.\n\nHers is one of many pet food companies trying to remake meat. Earlier this year,the British company Meatlysold a limited run of dog treats made with lab-grown chicken. BioCraft Pet Nutrition, in Austria, is working to turn stem cells from mice into food for cats and dogs. And Bond Pet Foods, in the United States, is using yeast to produce animal protein through the process of fermentation.\n\nThere\u2019s still substantial skepticism about the future of insect protein and lab-grown meat in the human food supply \u2014 and about whether such ingredients can really wean us off our rib-eyes and fried chicken. Some entrepreneurs see pet food as a natural proving ground.\n\nIf a company can \u201ccrack the code for pet food, the path to commercialization could be relatively easier,\u201d said Rich Kelleman, the chief executive of Bond Pet Foods. Pet food companies don\u2019t need to replicate the experience of biting into a perfectly crisped drumstick. \u201cFor dogs and cats, it has to taste good,\u201d Mr. Kelleman said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to taste like chicken, exactly.\u201d\n\nIndustrial animal agriculture takes a profound toll on the environment, requiring lots of land and water, and producing significant pollution, including greenhouse gases.\n\nThe pet food industry, which often uses agricultural byproducts, has a smaller environmental footprint than the human food sector. \u201cBut it is material, and we shouldn\u2019t ignore it,\u201d said Peter Alexander, an expert on global food systems at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nIna 2020 study, Dr. Alexander and his colleagues found that dry dog and cat food accounted for between 1 and 3 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with agriculture. (Wet food tends to contain more prime meat and have a higher impact.)\n\n\u201cFor individuals who maybe have a fairly low-emission diet and don\u2019t do much traveling, but they have a large dog \u2014 actually, the dog could have a really substantial footprint,\u201d Dr. Alexander said.\n\nInsects and lab-made animal protein have the potential to be far less damaging to the environment. And because pets tend to eat the same thing every day, changing their food \u201ccan have real impact,\u201d Ms. Carlson said. \u201cIt\u2019s like flipping a switch. One day it\u2019s unsustainable, the next, it\u2019s sustainable.\u201d\n\nReducing our reliance on industrial animal agriculture could also prevent immense animal suffering. \u201cIn the pet industry, it\u2019s all about loving animals,\u201d said Owen Ensor, the chief executive of Meatly. \u201cAnd I think a lot of people are increasingly uncomfortable with needing to harm and kill a lot of other animals to feed those animals.\u201d\n\nVegan pet food also addresses these problems but has to be very carefully formulated \u2014 and it won\u2019t appeal to all owners, alt-meat entrepreneurs say. \u201cPeople want to feed their pets meat,\u201d said Mr. Ensor, who is vegan but has two cats who are not.\n\nIn addition to Watson, I also have two cats. At first, figuring out how to feed them all was like trying to solve an impossible riddle.\n\nWatson, an intensely food-motivated dog with a heart condition, needs a weight-control kibble and must be kept away from the cat food, which he finds tantalizingly delicious. Juniper, my chronically underweight cat, should ideally have free access to her food \u2014 and is also a picky eater who reliably consumes only chicken. Then there\u2019s Goose, a cat who will eat until he makes himself sick and happens to have a food sensitivity to, yes, chicken.\n\nFinding the right meal plan for this menagerie took months of trial and error. So, as much as the sustainability and animal welfare arguments appeal to me, I\u2019m reluctant to start switching things up.\n\nI\u2019m not alone, apparently.\u201cWhat we\u2019re learning is that people don\u2019t really react or buy based on sustainability,\u201d Ms. Carlson said.\n\nShannon Falconer, the chief executive of BioCraft Pet Nutrition, agreed. \u201cThe main driver of any and all pet parent is the health of their animal,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will supersede anything else.\u201d In fact, another trend in the pet food market \u2014 the rise of high-end, human-grade products loaded with prime meat \u2014 runs directly counter to the quest for greater sustainability.\n\nSome companies are leaning hard into health claims. Insects, they say, are perfect for pets like Goose, who are sensitive or allergic to common proteins. It\u2019s a compelling argument, and if I ever need to find a new food for Goose, I\u2019d consider an insect-based one.\n\nBut I\u2019m not yet convinced by claims that insect protein is a \u201csuperfood\u201d \u2014 one that some companies suggest could improve everything from gut health and coat quality to cognition and immune function.\n\nResearch suggests that insects are indeed a \u201chigh-quality protein source,\u201d with good digestibility and palatability, said Kelly Swanson, a comparative nutritionist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. But data on specific functional benefits is limited, especially in cats and dogs. And companies will need to demonstrate that their products include enough of the ingredient to bring about whatever benefits they\u2019re promising, Dr. Swanson said.\n\nCreating nutritionally balanced products will require a deep understanding of these new proteins. Ina study published earlier this year, Belgian researchers found that many insect-based pet foods carried inaccurate nutritional labels, and that some of those products were deficient in one or more critical nutrients. \u201cThere are still a lot of gaps in the knowledge and research,\u201d said Camila Baptista da Silva, a doctoral student at Ghent University and an author of the study.\n\nFor their part, cultivated-meat companies note that their products are made without antibiotics or hormones, in controlled environments free of the pathogens that lurk in barns and slaughterhouses. But lab-grown meatisn\u2019t risk-free; it could contain novel allergens, or be contaminated by pathogens during the production process.\n\nUltimately, whether alternative proteins pay environmental dividends will depend on many factors, including how they are made \u2014 some production methods can be resource intensive \u2014 how widely they are adopted and what pet food products they displace.\n\nAs Dr. Alexander put it, \u201cIt all comes down to, \u2018What are you swapping from? What are you swapping to?\u2019\u201d Transitioning from pet food containing premium beef, which has an especially high environmental impact, to products with lab-grown meat would probably yield environmental benefits, he said. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m doubtful that switching from animal byproducts or plant-based ingredients to lab-grown meat will be beneficial,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd in order to have a real impact, alt-protein companies will need to produce these ingredients at higher quantities and lower prices. Meatly, which is currently raising money for an industrial-scale production facility, launched with a limited supply of dog treats made with just four percent cultivated chicken.\n\nYora Pet Foods sells large bags of its insect-based dog kibble for $4.50 to $5 a pound, more than one-and-a-half times what I pay for Watson\u2019s current food. At the moment, the grubs Yora uses cost almost as much to produce as free-range chicken, said James Milbourne, a managing director at the company. \u201cIf you walk into the shop and you\u2019ve got a bag of lovely free-range chicken and a bag of insects, and they\u2019re the same price,\u201d he said, \u201cit just makes it more difficult to get that person to take a punt on it.\u201d\n\nBut if companies can scale up and bring prices down, I do think customers will follow. Ina 2022 study, nearly half of dog and cat owners surveyed, including some who had no interest in eating lab-grown meat themselves, said they\u2019d be willing to feed cultivated meat to their pets.\n\nI\u2019d consider it, too, although there aren\u2019t currently such products available for purchase. And while I didn\u2019t want to change any of my pets\u2019 primary foods, I was happy to offer up some insect-based treats.\n\nGoose gobbled them down almost as quickly as Watson did. But fickle Juniper wouldn\u2019t touch the cricket treats, and she was hot and cold on the fly variety. Some days she seemed happy to scarf them down; other days she seemed almost offended by the offering. I could find no logic in her ever-shifting preferences. But there\u2019s no accounting for taste, I guess \u2014 or often, it seems, for cats.\n\nEmily Anthes is a science reporter, writing primarily about animal health and science.
