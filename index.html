The watch weighs 49 grams (about 1.7 ounces). It's 1.6 inches in diameter and 0.5 inches thick.", "date": "2025-05-13", "full_content": "Our Buyers Guide Top Picks\n\nThe UnaliWear Kanega Watch is a more discreet alternative to traditional medical alert devices. The watch weighs 49 grams (about 1.7 ounces). It\u2019s 1.6 inches in diameter and 0.5 inches thick. It comes with a patented quick-swap battery, so you never have to take it off to charge.\n\nThe UnaliWear Kanega Watch is a stand-alone personal emergency response device, so you don\u2019t need a landline or cellphone to make it work. Instead, it relies on Verizon\u2019s nationwide cellular network. The watch connects to your home Wi-Fi but automatically switches to Verizon\u2019s network when you leave your home.\n\nYou can call for help in multiple ways. If you press and hold the button on the right side of the watch (called the crown button) for a couple of seconds, you\u2019ll be connected to the monitoring center. These trained professionals have your contact information and the names of your caregivers and know exactly whom to notify and where to dispatch help.\n\nYou can also use voice commands through the watch\u2019s built-in microphone. Finally, if you fall, the watch automatically detects the unusual movement and notifies the monitors.\n\nUnaliWear offers two different pricing structures for the Kanega Watch. You can make an upfront payment for the whole year, or you can pay monthly from the start. No matter how you pay, you have a one-time setup fee.\n\nAs of publishing, if you choose to pay monthly from the start, your one-time setup fee is $299. Then, you\u2019ll pay $69.95 a month for monitoring services.\n\nThere\u2019s no contract with either payment structure, so you can cancel the service anytime. But note that the watch and the accessories aren\u2019t yours to keep. You have to return everything in good condition if you cancel the monitoring service.\n\nDesigned with an older user in mind, the UnaliWear Kanega Watch has many features to help improve independence, including:\n\nCompare UnaliWear with othermedical alert companies.\n\nThe company name comes from the Cherokee words \u201cUnalii,\u201d which means friend, and \u201cKanega,\u201d which means speak. When you put them together, you have a friend who speaks to you.\n\nUnaliWear covers defects in materials and workmanship for as long as you have it, as long as you are current on your service payments. If any issues come up, UnaliWear will replace the watch for free.\n\nThe company also covers replacement and shipping at no cost the first time you break the watch. Be aware that UnaliWear does not cover replacement of a watch in all circumstances.\n\nAfter 30 days, you can cancel the service at any time as long as you return all equipment. You\u2019ll get a refund (minus a $75 restocking fee) if all equipment is returned in good condition. Annual plans will be issued a prorated refund based on the nondiscounted monthly rate of $69.95.\n\nTo cancel your monitoring service through UnaliWear, you need to call the company\u2019s customer support team. As a part of the cancellation, you must send the equipment back in good condition. A lost or damaged watch results in a fee of up to $650.\n\nThe company\u2019s headquarters is in Austin, Texas.\n\nUnaliWear helps vulnerable people enjoy more independence through its medical alert technology. The stylish Kanega Watch includes 24/7 U.S.-based monitoring, fall detection, medication reminders and a 30-day money-back guarantee. Since the watch uses Wi-Fi and LTE technologies, wearers don\u2019t need a landline to access help. In addition, UnaliWear doesn\u2019t require a long-term contract.\n\nShop with confidence\n\nCompare with top companies\n\nFilter by Rating\n\nPopular Mentions\n\nA link has directed you to this review. Its location on this page may change next time you visit.\n\nReviewed Sept. 17, 2024\n\nThe Kanega Watch has been a lifesaver for my grandma (and mom!). My grandma lives independently and is able to continue to do so because the Kanega provides round the clock coverage in the case of an emergency. And even better, my mom can rest easy, knowing she's safe. We chose the Kanega because the 24/7 monitoring service already knows who she is when an alert comes from the watch. After doing so much research online, we found that the Kanega's coverage and service was far superior to others on the market. Totally worth the price!\n\nReviewed March 12, 2024\n\nI bought this watch for my mother in December 2023. Two months later the screen went blank and it was not usable. I made several calls and wrote emails to the company's customer service department. The calls repeatedly were answered by the \"overflow\" service department, which was not qualified to actually troubleshoot problems. After a week of no response on how to fix the watch, I returned it. If you want a watch that detects falls and will notify emergency services, I would suggest an Apple Watch. The Apple Watch does everything the Kanega does and more, and it costs less.\n\nThanks for subscribing.\n\nYou have successfully subscribed to our newsletter!

And the watch was heavy, too heavy for a small person to sleep when wearing. This may work better for larger folks, but if you're small, I would not recommend it. The $75 return fee is very steep and you need to go through customer service, which tries and tries to change your mind, to return it.\n\nReviewed Nov. 15, 2023\n\nWe got the Kanega Watch for my father several years ago. He loves it and he wears it all the time, which is the total point. The fall detection has worked as advertised, and he enjoys asking his watch for the time and date. Tremendous peace of mind for him and our whole family. I highly recommend!\n\nReviewed Oct. 22, 2023\n\nI purchased the watch on 9/6/2023, I received it around 9/11/2023. I lost a battery out of it on 10/2/2023, I had no idea how I lost it. Now on 10/22/2023 the watch band has broken where it attaches with the battery to watch. Very unhappy with the construction as I bought a battery for about $36 plus shipping about 3 weeks after purchase and now about 6 weeks later it is broken. I am emailing the company today to see what they will do about this situation. I paid $918.40. I would expect a better quality.\n\nReviewed Sept. 16, 2023\n\nThe service is great. There is very little set up and it is very easy to do. Once we received the watch there were 3 very short videos to watch and then you call the center and they do a test call with you. My Aunt loves the device because it isn't a pendant that gets in the way, flops around or looks out of place when she dresses up and goes out. She also likes the fact that she never has to take it off and can wear it in the shower.\n\nOur only complaint is that after only 3 months the first watch band broke where the battery goes in. We didn't realize it cracked and one battery was lost and then the band broke all together. I believe that a more rubberized battery chamber would be a better housing for the battery. The other disappointment was we had to pay $50 for shipping for a new watch. This seems a bit steep. We haven't found anything better at this time but the shipping cost did cause the luster of this product to dull somewhat.\n\nCheck out our buyers guide top picks\n\nOur Buyers Guide Top Picks:", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Unaliwear", "title": "7 Best Medical Altert Systems For Seniors With Fall Detection 2025", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/7-best-medical-altert-systems-for-seniors-with-fall-detection-2025/vi-AA1EKrC1", "source": "Amazon S3", "body": "Best Medical Altert Systems For Seniors With Fall Detection 2025 Links to the best Medical Altert Systems are listed down below: \u25ba 7.

As a leader in the secondary marketplace, eBay partnered with the British Fashion Council, Council of Fashion Designers of America, Fashion Council Germany and Australia Fashion Council to recognize the innovators driving this sustainable change to provide not only capital but access and visibility to propel growth.\n\nMore from WWD\n\nFaherty Expands 'Second Wave' Resale Program With Mail-in Option\n\nHow Tapestry Drives Adaptable Digital Journeys With Technology\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Salma Hayek Pinault Is Merz Aesthetics' First Global Ambassador for Ultrasound Treatment Ultherapy Prime\n\n\u201cAs the pioneering secondary marketplace,eBayhas been driving circularity in fashion since its inception 30 years ago,\u201d saidAlexis Hoopes, vice president, and global head of fashion at eBay. \u201cIt\u2019s a critical time for the fashion industry, and eBay\u2019s Circular Fashion Fund \u2014 and the eBay platform at large \u2014 are propelling the industry forward, enabling innovative ideas to help shape brand and consumer behaviors.\u201d\n\nDesigned to support start-ups to scale circular solutions from production to end of life, the Circular Fashion Fund\u2019s search for Innovator of the Year looked across the U.K., U.S., Germany and Australia, shortlisting 12 companies that were recognized as pioneers in circular fashion. These finalists were chosen by a judging panel of industry experts within the fields of fashion, academia andsustainability.\n\nAs this year\u2019s winner, Refiberd will use the funding to scale the impact of its intelligent sorting solution for textile-to-textile recycling AI system. The company\u2019s mission tackles the industry\u2019s waste-sorting problem to drive true circularity in fashion.\n\nAccording to the company, the technology \u201ccan be integrated into existing recycling infrastructures to sort materials and ensure they\u2019re processed using the right methods.\u201d In practice, this will help recyclers turn textile waste into new, usable fibers.\n\n\u201cThe investment from eBay Ventures will help us close a significant round of fundraising for the business, allowing us to expand our technology to new recycling partners, strengthen our AI capabilities and move faster toward our mission of enabling true textile-to-textile recycling,\u201d said Sarika Bajaj, cofounder and chief executive officer of Refiberd. \u201cThe journey for a startup is tough, so having the mentorship and access to eBay and the CFDA\u2019s networks has already proven invaluable. With this added support we can accelerate our impact and help build a future where circular fashion is the norm \u2014 not the exception.\u201d\n\nEBay continues to champion re-commerce through its Circular Fashion Fund and champion the increased appetite for circular fashion. Notably, the company\u2019s research revealed that 66 percent of Gen Z say that purchasing pre-loved fashion has grown in personal importance.\n\nSince its launch in 2022, the fund has supported 27 businesses and provided more than 200 hours of mentoring and upskilling from industry experts with a total investment of $1.2 million.\n\nBest of WWD\n\nThe Definitive Timeline for Sean 'Diddy' Combs' Sean John Fashion Brand: Lawsuits, Runway Shows and Who Owns It Now\n\nWhat the Highest-paid CEOs at U.S. Fashion and Retail Companies Make\n\nConfidence Holds Up, But How Much Can Consumers Take?\n\nSign up forWWD's Newsletter.
