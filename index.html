Unlike ...", "date": "2023-08-30", "full_content": "A medical alert system with on-call emergency operators can provide peace of mind for older adults and their loved ones.\n\nWhether it provides immediate professional support after a middle-of-the-night fall or simply summons help with everyday tasks from a neighbor, friend, or family member, a medical alert system can make life easier for everyone.\n\nThe available options are far from perfect. We\u2019ve tested 22 systems over the past two years, and we\u2019ve found significant drawbacks with all of them. The reliability of some of the devices was dangerously lacking. Also, many of the most recognizable companies\u2014including the maker of a former Wirecutter pick\u2014proved to be overly aggressive in their sales tactics, and a few were downright predatory.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no singular \u201cbest\u201d medical alert system, we\u2019ve identified the best options in three different categories. TheUnaliWear Kanega Watchis the best on-the-go medical alert device.Alexa Emergency Assistis the best home-based option that you don\u2019t have to wear. AndLifeFone At-Home Cellularis the best traditional home-based medical alert system.\n\nThis smartwatch-style system doesn\u2019t have to be removed for charging, and it\u2019s stress-free to set up and use. But it\u2019s expensive, and its GPS wasn\u2019t always accurate during testing.\n\nThis voice-activated system is unobtrusive and effective, with a quick response time and low long-term cost. But if you need features like fall detection, or you can\u2019t use voice activation, this isn\u2019t the one for you.\n\nThis system is louder and more conspicuous than our other picks, but it\u2019s straightforward, and it offers multiple ways to call for help.\n\nThe medical alert system should offer straightforward setup, be easy to use, and have compassionate emergency operators.\n\nWe considered only companies with websites that offer transparent information on pricing structures and/or plans.\n\nThe system should make it easy for someone to call for help or get in touch with emergency contacts. Medication reminders and fall detection are a plus.\n\nIt should be subtle and not announce to others that it's a medical alert system.\n\nThis smartwatch-style system doesn\u2019t have to be removed for charging, and it\u2019s stress-free to set up and use. But it\u2019s expensive, and its GPS wasn\u2019t always accurate during testing.\n\nTheUnaliWear Kanega Medical Alert Watchlooks like a smartwatch, but it\u2019s actually a robust medical alert system that you can use to send an alert by voice or with the push of a button. Unlike a home-based system, the Kanega Watch can go with you wherever you need to go, whether you\u2019re taking a shower or a trip to the grocery store (though its GPS wasn\u2019t always able to locate us if we weren\u2019t connected to Wi-Fi). And unlike a standard smartwatch (like the Apple Watch), the Kanega Watch has a full staff of trained agents behind it to answer your calls\u2014emergency or otherwise\u2014at any time of the day or night.\n\nBut with its $299 setup fee and a nearly $80 monthly service charge, the Kanega Watch is the priciest designated medical alert system of those we tested. (If you pay for an annual subscription, rather than a monthly one, it averages out to about $65 a month.) If the Kanega Watch is financially out of reach, but you\u2019d still like a medical alert device that can go with you when you leave the house, we think theLifeFone Safe Watch Activeis a solid, less-expensive alternative.\n\nThis voice-activated system is unobtrusive and effective, with a quick response time and low long-term cost. But if you need features like fall detection, or you can\u2019t use voice activation, this isn\u2019t the one for you.\n\nAlexa Emergency Assistisn\u2019t a traditional medical alert system; it\u2019s a subscription service that works with Amazon Alexa devices. We were surprised to find that it was one of our favorites during testing. It had the fastest response time of any system we tested, and the emergency-response-center agents were consistently friendly and easy to hear.\n\nFor those who already have an Alexa device set up, subscribing to Emergency Assist is fast, simple, and incredibly cheap ($59 annually for Prime members, $79 without Prime) compared with other systems we tested. But if you have trouble with voice-activated systems, or you prefer to press a physical button, the only option is to use the app on your phone.\n\nIf you can set up a new computer or cell phone, setting up Alexa\u2019s smart-home system will be a breeze. That said, if you\u2019re setting it up on your own, and you\u2019re easily frustrated by new technology, it may not be the most intuitive or quickest system for you, compared with others we tested that have dedicated customer-service teams.\n\nThis system is louder and more conspicuous than our other picks, but it\u2019s straightforward, and it offers multiple ways to call for help.\n\nTheLifeFone At-Home Cellularmedical alert system won\u2019t fool anyone into thinking it\u2019s anything but a medical alert device. However, its functionality and use of AT&T\u2019s wireless network make it the best option for those looking for a standard, home-based system with good coverage. It comes with a base unit with a help button, and you can add wearable components (a neck pendant or a wristband) with notably easy-to-push buttons. If you\u2019d prefer a landline connection instead, theLifeFone At-Home Landlineis a comparable system, but we didn\u2019t test it.\n\nThe monthly fee for this device\u2014with one wearable pendant\u2014starts at $31, if you pay annually (it\u2019s $35 if you pay monthly); we found this fee to be pretty typical of those for similar medical alert systems. And the LifeFone\u2019s lack of one-time setup fees made it more affordable than others we tested.\n\nAnna Wenner is the author of several Wirecutter guides to products that are designed to make your home more accessible\u2014includinggrab bars,shower mats, andtoilet-seat risers. She\u2019s helped her own family members choose the right medical alert systems for their needs, so she understands how many challenges are involved in navigating this product category.\n\nPamela Appea is a health and science journalist who\u2019s covered a range of topics that impact older adults, including dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, access to emergency medical care, and health disparities among older people of color. She was a fellow in Columbia University\u2019sAge Boom Academy, for journalists who cover aging issues. And she has firsthand experience with older relatives who lost their independence due to falls or medical emergencies at home.\n\nFor this guide:\n\nA medical alert system can help someone maintain their independence by ensuring that they can get help when they need it\u2014whether they\u2019re at home or out and about. Unlike a smartphone orsmartwatch, these systems provide an extra layer of support during health and other emergencies by quickly connecting to representatives who can help you or a loved one navigate the situation.\n\nWhen an older person needs help, it doesn\u2019t always warrant a 911 call. Oftentimes, support from a neighbor or friend will suffice. And when a person is experiencing a medical emergency and dials 911, it\u2019s not always easy for a 911 operator to interpret a hang-up call or to understand the caller\u2019s medical history, especially if they\u2019re unable to speak. That\u2019s what can make a medical alert system a lifesaver.\n\nWe focused on devices for two main groups of adults:\n\nOlder adults aren\u2019t the only ones who can benefit from these devices. Those with certain disabilities or chronic health issues may find it helpful to have the added security of a medical alert system with a dedicated call center, whether it\u2019s temporarily, after an injury or surgery, or for a longer period.\n\nMedical alert systems can also provide caregivers, including adult children, invaluable peace of mind. Whether a caregiver is helping from across the country or just across town, it\u2019s beneficial for them to know when a loved one is using their medical alert system and to hear from a live agent. Depending on the preferences that are set, some companies may call or text a designated caregiver or emergency contact to notify them if the medical alert system has been activated, if the battery is low, or if the device hasn\u2019t been used in a while.\n\nThese systems can be costly, so while most health insurance plans don\u2019t cover them, it\u2019s still worth checking with your insurance provider. If you have a flexible spending account (FSA) or a health savings account (HSA), you can use income-tax-free money to help pay for certain devices.\n\nWhen it comes to pricing, the fees can add up. If you\u2019re on a tighter budget, keep in mind that some companies offer promotional or locked-in discounted rates. And if you\u2019re a veteran who receives services from the Department of Veterans Affairs, you can obtain a medical alert system through your VA provider at no out-of-pocket cost to you.\n\nThese are the essential features we looked for:\n\nWe tested 14 medical alert systems in 2023. In 2024, we completed another round of testing, with eight additional models (and we retested four from the first round).\n\nWe tested each of the medical alert systems for at least a week as we went about our daily lives. We tested them in such vastly varied places as a New York City apartment building, a sunflower field in Kansas, and the basement of a suburban home. And to evaluate response times, we tested each device on different days of the week and times of day. We also repeatedly tested on-the-go systems for their location-tracking abilities.\n\nFor all of the devices, we went to every corner of our homes to see how strong the signal was and what obstacles it could make it through. While some systems struggled with getting a signal in places like a backyard, others could get one even from the farthest corners of a basement.\n\nThough many of our devices were loaned for the purpose of testing, we otherwise approached each company as an anonymous customer. This meant that when something went wrong, we reached out to customer service, and we even made phone calls using a Google Voice number to see how companies interacted with prospective customers.\n\nWe spoke with people who have arthritis and hearing loss to determine which accessibility features were important to them and where the systems struggled to meet their needs. We also tested each alert method with accessibility in mind, factoring in how difficult a button was to press, how loud a voice response was, and how clearly the operator could be heard.\n\nThis smartwatch-style system doesn\u2019t have to be removed for charging, and it\u2019s stress-free to set up and use. But it\u2019s expensive, and its GPS wasn\u2019t always accurate during testing.\n\nTheUnaliWear Kanega Medical Alert Watchis an attractive medical alert system that looks like a smartwatch yet isn\u2019t one. This unobtrusive, stylish device, which relies on the Verizon network, is a good option for those who want a medical alert device that doesn\u2019t look like one, as well as for those who want to be able to take it with them when they leave home.\n\nWe think the Kanega Watch is the best mobile medical alert device. But if you\u2019re looking for a less expensive option, or if Verizon doesn\u2019t have good coverage in your area, we recommend theLifeFone Safe Watch Active; it uses AT&T\u2019s network, and it beat out the Kanega Watch\u2019s GPS accuracy in some locations during our testing.\n\nThe Kanega Watch makes contacting live agents easy.You can either push a button or verbally tell the watch you need help by using the set wake words \u201cFred Astaire\u201d and then asking the watch to \u201cGet help.\u201d From there, it will connect you to one of the company\u2019s emergency operators. If you do not verbally respond after you\u2019ve been connected, the agent will contact emergency services and a designated contact within a specified time period.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to take it off to charge it.The watch comes with four lithium ion batteries, two of which can always be charging in the included battery charger. When the batteries in the watch lose their charge (after about 24 to 36 hours), you should swap them out for the fully charged batteries; you can do this without having to remove the watch from your wrist. Every other wearable device we tested had to be removed for charging, leaving the user vulnerable for that time period and increasing the chances that they won\u2019t have the device when they really need it. We also love that the Kanega Watch includes a backup battery built into the watch, so even if a few hours lapse between battery switches, you\u2019ll still have access to help.\n\nIt\u2019s less obtrusive than a standard medical alert device.When activated, the Kanega Watch calmly states that it\u2019s calling the operator for help. This is in stark contrast to other devices we tested, which often made alarming beeps and loud statements like \u201cemergency alert!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s stylish and adjustable.Even though most of Anna\u2019s family and friends were aware she was testing medical alert systems, none of them identified the Kanega Watch as one. The watch face and clasp come in three colors: black, champagne gold, and rose gold. The wristband is customized to your wrist size when you order it, and you can adjust it even more precisely when you receive it. Although it was generally comfortable, the closing mechanism sometimes pinched and could be difficult to use, and the wristband chafed when it was wet. We also found this watch to be a little bulkier than a typical smartwatch, particularly on small wrists.\n\nIt connects to Verizon\u2019s cellular network and Wi-Fi.While most on-the-go systems we tested rely solely on a cellular network, the Kanega Watch pulls from a combination of Wi-Fi and Verizon\u2019s network (you don\u2019t need to be a Verizon customer or buy a separate plan to use it). So its coverage is more comprehensive, especially in buildings. Although you can set up only seven Wi-Fi networks for the device to remember, that often will be enough, since you can cover the most pivotal places, like home, work, and other buildings where you\u2019re most likely to be on your own.\n\nSetting it up is simple.This is one of only a few medical alert systems we tested that we could have given to any of our family members to set up themselves. Every step is clear, concise, and laid out, and the customer-service line is responsive and helpful if you have any issues.\n\nIts live agents and customer-service reps are very responsive.The emergency and customer-service operators were among the best we encountered. In our first round of testing, in 2023, we found that they consistently responded within 30 to 60 seconds of our call. However, the response times were slower (more than four minutes in one case) during our more-recent testing\u2014particularly when the watch wasn\u2019t connected to Wi-Fi.\n\nIt comes with fall-detection capabilities.Although fall detection is never going to be 100% reliable in any device, the Kanega Watch detected most of our simulated falls. It sometimes skewed to the overly sensitive side. But you can adjust that by asking customer service to recalibrate the fall-detection settings and tailor them to your activity level\u2014whether you\u2019re playing tennis, moving items around your home, or staying supine while recovering from surgery. The watch is also supposed to learn from past false alarms (it was hard to tell how effective that was from our testing). And unlike almost all of the other medical alert systems we tested, this one doesn\u2019t impose an extra fee for fall detection.\n\nFalse alarms are easy to dismiss.Due to the Kanega Watch\u2019s sensitivity, it had more false alarms than any other devices we tested. But this was less of a hassle than it was with other systems, since it was relatively painless to dismiss the alert before it went to the call center. Out of 17 accidental alerts (either from fall detection or voice detection), only one actually made it to the call center before we were able to cancel it, and that was partially due to how quickly they answered. If you\u2019re getting a lot of false alarms, you can ask customer service to adjust the sensitivity.\n\nIt can remind you to take your medications.The Kanega Watch is one of the few systems we tested (along withAmazon Alexa devices,Apple watches, and theOneCare CareWatch) that have an included feature to remind you to take your medications. (Some other systems offer this for an extra fee.)\n\nIt has useful features for people with vision or hearing loss.This device has a large, easy-to-read screen, which is particularly useful for people who have trouble reading smaller type sizes. In Pamela\u2019s tests in New York, the call quality was crystal-clear. During Anna\u2019s tests in Kansas, service was spottier. And it was sometimes hard to hear through the watch\u2019s speaker, but the agents always quickly called her cell phone if they couldn\u2019t hear her. If you have hearing loss, you can contact the company\u2019s customer-service team to create a personalized sound level tailored to your hearing ability.\n\nIt\u2019s water-resistant.Like almost all of the medical alert systems we tested, the device is resistant to running water, so you can wear it in the shower or while you\u2019re exercising, but you should never submerge it in water.\n\nIt\u2019s covered under a (limited) warranty.UnaliWear covers defects in the watch, as long as you have an active service plan. If you don\u2019t like the watch, you can return it within 30 days of the shipment date for a full refund, but you\u2019ll have to pay a $75 restocking fee.\n\nIt\u2019s expensive.The Kanega Watch\u2019s one-time setup fee of $299 is one of the highest among those of medical alert systems we tested, as is the monthly service fee of almost $80 (or $65 if you pay annually).\n\nGPS tracking wasn\u2019t reliable everywhere we tested.During our most recent testing, we were disappointed with the accuracy of the device\u2019s GPS, particularly because it was among the most accurate when we tested it in 2023. While there are a lot of factors that affect GPS, four times out of 10, the watch couldn\u2019t locate Anna, who was testing from the Kansas City metro area, in any way. And one of those times, operators incorrectly told Anna\u2019s emergency contact that she was at home. When the watch was connected to Wi-Fi, though, it always showed the correct location.\n\nVoice activation can be tricky to use.While we loved that voice activation was an option, it wasn\u2019t as intuitive as we would have liked. We didn\u2019t like that you couldn\u2019t change the wake words, \u201cFred Astaire,\u201d which in theory was memorable but ultimately easy to mix up with names of other famous contemporaries. After saying the wake words, you then need to say \u201cGet help,\u201d but this doesn\u2019t work with slight variations or just by saying \u201cHelp.\u201d Even when we did remember the wake words, the watch didn\u2019t always recognize it, but when we asked the call center to increase the sensitivity, we got frequent false alarms during regular conversations.\n\nThe batteries aren\u2019t as easy to remove as the company claims.Despite how much we love the Kanega Watch\u2019s always-charged system, the batteries can be difficult to swap out. Anna, who is in her 30s and has full use of her hands, at times had trouble dislodging the batteries from the watch and often dropped them in the process. At one point, a battery broke and became stuck, but customer service provided helpful advice on removing it, and it sent a new battery within days.\n\nThis voice-activated system is unobtrusive and effective, with a quick response time and low long-term cost. But if you need features like fall detection, or you can\u2019t use voice activation, this isn\u2019t the one for you.\n\nAlexa Emergency Assistdiffers from the other medical alert systems we tested because it does not have a designated device or app. Instead, it\u2019s an optional subscription within the Amazon Alexa app that works through anyAmazon Echodevice.\n\nAlexa Emergency Assist easily had the fastest response time of the systems we tested, and it was the most straightforward and least stressful to use. Altogether, purchasing it and setting it up took less than five minutes\u2014the quickest of any system we tested. But if you\u2019re not tech-savvy, or if you\u2019ll have trouble remembering to say the wake word (set to \u201cAlexa\u201d as default) before you make a request, this system may feel less intuitive. And not everyone will be comfortable having a device in their home that\u2019s always \u201clistening.\u201d\n\nIt has the shortest response time.On average, Alexa Emergency Assist took 14.6 seconds to connect Anna with a live operator, the speediest time of any system we tested by far. Its quickest response was a mere 7 seconds\u201413 seconds less than it took the next fastest system we tested.\n\nIt\u2019s a discerning listener.The Alexa system ignored the wake word if we said it in a calm way during a conversation (for example, explaining to someone how it worked), but it immediately responded anytime we were trying to alert it during testing. It was able to pick up on the need for assistance with a variety of phrases, including \u201cAlexa, help,\u201d \u201cAlexa, I\u2019ve fallen,\u201d \u201cAlexa, call for help,\u201d and \u201cAlexa, get help.\u201d A major problem with the other voice-activated alerts is that they respond to only a very specific phrase, such as, \u201cCall for help\u201d (but not \u201cGet help\u201d). You can also change the wake word from \u201cAlexa\u201d to something easier to remember (for those out there still trying to ask \u201cAmanda\u201d or \u201cAlice\u201d to turn on the music), such as \u201cAmazon,\u201d \u201cEcho,\u201d \u201cComputer,\u201d or \u201cZiggy.\u201d\n\nYou can add as many speakers as you need.Most other home-based systems rely on a single base unit for an entire home. With this system, you can add an Alexa device to every room you spend time in (which we recommend). This distinguishes the system from most other home-based ones we tested, which don\u2019t have the range to fully cover a larger house and often don\u2019t let you add additional bases to extend the range. We were impressed by how far we could be from the Alexa device and how quietly we could speak while still getting a response.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly cheap, if you already have Alexa speakers.Though outfitting your home with Amazon\u2019s smart-home speakers isn\u2019t exactly inexpensive, the actual emergency service is refreshingly affordable. At just $5 to $8 a month (depending on whether you pay monthly or annually and if you\u2019re a Prime member), this system is easily the least expensive one we tested. For those with smaller homes, such as a one-bedroom apartment or condo, the one-time cost (about $120) you\u2019d need to pay for three or so devices is still less expensive than for any other system we tested.\n\nCaregivers, family members, and friends can \u201cdrop in\u201d if they have Echo devices.If caregivers, family members, and friends have Echo speakers, they can call your Echo, and vice versa, or they can \u201cdrop in\u201d to check on you. You can also set up multiple Echo devices to use as an intercom system, so you can communicate with others in the same home.\n\nIt can alert you to alarms in your home.Alexa Emergency Assist sends you a notification on your phone if a fire alarm is going off in your home, and it even allows you to listen to the alarm live (to decide whether it\u2019s real or just coming from a TV show) and have a recording for later. (It also advertises that it can notify you about the sound of breaking glass, but we didn\u2019t get any response after breaking glass directly next to the Alexa speaker multiple times.)\n\nIt has a \u201cwhisper\u201d mode.If you enable whisper mode, Alexa will automatically match its volume to yours, so if you need to call for help quietly, you aren\u2019t announcing it across the house. (You can leave whisper mode turned off if you\u2019re more concerned with being able to hear the response than with getting help quietly.)\n\nIt works seamlessly with Apple and Android phones.The Alexa app works equally well on iPhones and Android phones; this distinguishes it from other systems we tested with apps that were compatible with only one phone operating system or that had different apps for Apple and Android phones.\n\nIt relies almost entirely on voice activation.If using voice activation is a challenge, the only alternative is to send an alert from your phone. This won\u2019t work as well for people who prefer a single-use button or who have trouble speaking clearly.\n\nThere\u2019s a learning curve.If this is your first time using smart-home devices, it might take some getting used to. If you have multiple Alexa speakers for different rooms, it can be a pain to get the devices to work together as a system. While Alexa Emergency Assist itself is easy to install and set up, there isn\u2019t a simple way to talk to a customer-service agent if you\u2019re having issues. And there\u2019s no real training on how to use the system, unlike with others we tested.\n\nIts listening capabilities may make some people uncomfortable.We know some people don\u2019t like the idea of being listened to by artificial intelligence in general, and we discuss the pros and consat length here. Note that for Alexa to function, it requires a constant connection to the internet and the ability to listen for a wake word, which triggers it to act. While you can mute the microphone, that would prevent the use of Alexa Emergency Assistance.\n\nThe cost of multiple speakers can add up for bigger spaces.If Anna followed Amazon\u2019s guidelines to the letter for her own home, she\u2019d need five devices just for the main floor. However, during testing she had only three to four active at once on the main floor, and this never posed a problem. So a lot will depend on the layout of your home and how you use the spaces.\n\nThere\u2019s no battery backup, so the system won\u2019t function during a power outage.Unlike traditional home-based medical alert systems, Amazon Echo speakers and other devices don\u2019t have backup batteries. If the power goes out, your device turns off, which is obviously less than ideal in an emergency.\n\nThis system is louder and more conspicuous than our other picks, but it\u2019s straightforward, and it offers multiple ways to call for help.\n\nTheLifeFone At-Home Cellularincludes a base unit with a speaker and one of two wearable options, a neck pendant or a wristband (you can call for help anywhere in your home using the wearable buttons, but you can only speak with a live agent through the base). The compact design and quick operator response times make this the best option for those who need emergency assistance only at home and those who want a simple system that doesn\u2019t involve fiddling with technology. LifeFone also offers a similar system for those who rely on a landline: theLifeFone At-Home Landline.\n\nUnlike that of theKanega WatchandAlexa Emergency Assist, LifeFone\u2019s technology isn\u2019t unique. In fact, we suspected that it was the exact same base unit sold by other companies. A large part of its appeal is that it looks and functions like a traditional medical alert system is expected to: To call for help, you simply push a physical button. This makes it more intuitive to understand and use for those who are especially technology-averse. If you need to cancel your service, there are no cancellation fees, but you do have to return the equipment first.\n\nIt\u2019s straightforward to use.For those who are easily confused or frustrated by technology, LifeFone is a no-fuss alternative to more-confusing setups. The only thing the wearer needs to remember about their LifeFone system is that the buttons on the wearable and on the base will get them help when they need it. And there are additional buttons available for purchase that can be positioned around the house, if the wearable device isn\u2019t your preference, or if you just want to supplement it.\n\nIt\u2019s accessible to those with limited dexterity.If you opt for LifeFone\u2019s pendant button, putting it on is effortless: It goes over the head, and it has a magnetic closure that\u2019s easy to undo and redo, even for those with limited dexterity or strength. You also don\u2019t need to use two hands to put it on or take it off, unlike with a wristband-style device like the Kanega Watch.\n\nYou can choose how you want to wear it.Though LifeFone comes with only one button included in its base price, you can choose whether you want it to come as a pendant, a wristband, or a pendant with fall detection (for an additional $5 per month). You can also use the button on the base to call for help if you\u2019re closer to it than to one of the wearable buttons.\n\nThe buttons are water-resistant.The wearable buttons are all resistant to running water, so they can be worn in the shower, during exercise, or while you\u2019re washing your hands. However, they shouldn\u2019t be submerged in water for any length of time.\n\nIt connects to AT&T\u2019s cellular network.If Verizon doesn\u2019t have good coverage in your area, LifeFone may work better for you than the Kanega Watch because LifeFone uses AT&T\u2019s cell towers. For those who have little cell coverage in their home at all, LifeFone also offers a very similar landline option, theLifeFone At-Home Landline(which we did not test). However, unlike the Kanega Watch and Alexa Emergency Assist, LifeFone does not utilize Wi-Fi, so it might not have as strong of a signal in large buildings.\n\nIt can monitor room temperature.The system can send an alert if the temperature of the room where the base is located goes above or below your customized range.\n\nThere are no setup or cancellation fees.Unlike most other medical alert systems we tested, including the Kanega Watch, there\u2019s no fee when you purchase or activate the system. If you decide that LifeFone isn\u2019t working for you, you can return it for a full refund, if it\u2019s within 30 days of your service starting (you will have to pay for the return shipping). After that, you can still cancel your service at any time with no penalties and get a refund for any full months that were prepaid (such as if you paid for a full year). But the cancellation is effective only after you\u2019ve returned the equipment.\n\nThe only way to speak to a live agent is through the base.The range on the LifeFone\u2019s base speaker is fairly impressive (up to 1,300 feet) compared with the ranges of similar devices we tested. But it is not ideal that there\u2019s only a two-way speaker on the base device and not on the wearable buttons themselves. And unlike with the Alexa Emergency Assist system, with the LifeFone, you can\u2019t add multiple bases. So if you set off the device by mistake while you\u2019re in an area of the home or yard where you can\u2019t hear the alarm go off, you\u2019re more likely to have a false alarm reach your emergency contacts or 911.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to cancel a false alarm.One of the most frustrating things about this system\u2014and most classic home-based systems\u2014is that you cannot cancel an alert once it\u2019s been made. While this may seem like a small price to pay for a good medical alert system, it can get annoying fast. Particularly when fall detection was enabled, Anna would often set off the alarm when she took off the pendant and put it on a table. When she was particularly careful, this didn\u2019t happen. But if you have a tendency to hurriedly drop things on a table between activities, you can probably expect the fall detection to go off a lot.\n\nThe alarm can be anxiety-inducing.Compared with some of the other home-based systems we tested, the LifeFone was practically relaxing, but it nonetheless has the same anxiety-inducing loud noises of any alert in this category. Because it must be loud in order to be heard around the house, the sound of the initial alarm can be majorly startling (especially if you didn\u2019t realize you set it off).\n\nIf you want more than one wearable button, it\u2019s going to cost more.It is nice that you can get extra pendants, and that they don\u2019t have an additional monthly cost, as so many of LifeFone\u2019s competitors do. But $40 is still a hefty price to pay just to have a second button.\n\nThere\u2019s no pretending it\u2019s anything but a medical alert device.LifeFone is subtler than some of the other home-based medical alert systems we tested, but due to its neutral colors, it\u2019s still obviously a medical alert device, and it must be placed prominently in your home to get the best signal.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a less-expensive smartwatch-like medical device:ConsiderLifeFone Safe Watch ActiveorLifeStation Sidekick Smart. LifeFone and LifeStation appear to use the same smartwatch technology for their on-the-go systems. During testing, we found the watches themselves to be more or less identical. Ultimately, however, we liked the LifeFone Safe Watch better than the LifeStation Sidekick Smart because of its lower price, lack of activation fee, lower fall-detection fee, and slightly more accurate GPS location tracking. That said, both watches were safe and reliable.\n\nIf you want an alternative home-based medical alert system:TheADT Medical Alert Plushas an easy plug-in setup, with no landline or installation required. The pendants have a 600-foot range from the base unit, and the backup battery lasts up to 30 hours after a power outage. Like our LifeFone pick, it\u2019s best for those who want a home system they can attach to the wall in a central location, while wearing a corresponding pendant or wristband that\u2019s paired with the base unit. The device can also monitor the room\u2019s temperature, and for an extra fee, you can add fall detection. However, we found that the device connected more slowly to a live operator than others we tested, with the longest wait time being two minutes.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a medical alert system you can use outside, but you don\u2019t want a smartwatch:TryADT\u2019s On-The-Go,Bay Alarm Medical\u2019s SOS All-In-One 2, orLifeFone\u2019s VIPx. While none of them are exactly hiding that they\u2019re medical alert devices, all offer a relatively subtle, convenient way to have help on hand.\n\nADT\u2019s mobile option, ADT On-The-Go, is a small, mobile device that you can use at home or outside. Like the home-based systems, the mobile base unit pairs with either a neck pendant or a wristband, and you can add fall detection for an additional monthly fee. We didn\u2019t like it as much as theKanega Watchbecause it\u2019s less subtle and has to be taken off every day to charge, but it\u2019s still a worthwhile and much less-expensive alternative to our top pick.\n\nThe Bay Alarm Medical SOS All-In-One 2 is a small, no-frills, GPS-enabled mobile device that offers access to emergency help with a long-lasting battery life of 72 hours. The system comes with an app for caregivers, which allows them to monitor the wearer\u2019s location and whether the device\u2019s battery is running low. (We recommend always getting the consent of the person wearing the device before setting up any kind of location tracking or monitoring, if possible.) Although Bay Alarm Medical\u2019s GPS capabilities usually came close to our current location, they weren\u2019t entirely accurate when we were out and about. We like that the company offers attractive pendant covers to conceal the device, but the additional $25 charge is hefty.\n\nLifeFone\u2019s VIPx pendant had strong location tracking, easily identifying exactly where we were in every test but one (where it came within a house of us). The response time was nearly always under 30 seconds, and the call center was patient and friendly. However, the speaker on this pendant is a little on the quiet side, which was nice for drawing less attention in public, but it was sometimes hard to hear amid even moderate ambient noise. So the VIPx is a good alternative but not one of our picks.\n\nWe decided not to test models manufactured byLife Alert(of \u201cHelp! I\u2019ve fallen and I can\u2019t get up!\u201d fame). Founded in the 1980s, this company is synonymous with medical alert systems. However, we found this company to be confusing and predatory in how it interacts with potential customers.\n\nThe pricing is not readily available on the Life Alert website, and it took calling two different numbers and a 15-minute sales pitch to finally be told the price. The sales representative leaned into aggressive sales techniques and was actively combative when pressed for any basic details, such as the monthly cost, activation fees, and the length and terms of the contract.\n\nUnlike the other devices we tested, Life Alert requires customers to sign a 36-month contract that can be broken only if the customer goes into full-time care or dies. It also has one of the most expensive activation fees of any we tested ($247 at the time of writing) and the most expensive monthly cost ($90 per month).\n\nWe were excited about the Martha Stewart\u2013backedSilvertree Reachafter testing it\u2014and we actually found it to be one of our favorite on-the-go systems. However, the company has since closed down.\n\nWe no longer recommend Medical Guardian\u2019sMGHome Cellular, a former pick.\n\nMedical Guardian\u2019s MGHome Cellular was previously our top pick partly because of its quick and friendly responses. However, when we tested again, in late 2024, we found that the default setting is for all calls for assistance to be answered by an automated voice. It didn\u2019t understand any responses we gave besides a clear \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d and although it did eventually send us to a real human, the impersonal nature and frustrating process were impossible to get past. While you can disable this setting, it isn\u2019t communicated clearly to customers that this is an option. In addition, we found that the voice-activated wall button did not work consistently, that cancelling service involved a previously undisclosed restocking fee, and that getting in touch with any sort of customer-service person was nearly impossible.\n\nAfter cancelling our Medical Guardian subscription and returning the product, we began getting emails intended for the system\u2019s new owners. These emails included the names of both the new user and their emergency contact. When we approached Medical Guardian\u2019s customer service about the mistake, we were told the new users would not be notified that their information had been exposed because we didn\u2019t have \u201ctheir private information. Just names.\u201d In an email, senior director of brand and member experience Mischa Kregstein said this was an isolated incident and that she \u201ccan confirm that no member personal health information was shared, and all standard security protocols functioned as designed.\u201d However, given the highly personal nature of a medical alert device, this still felt like a gross breach of privacy.\n\nFor similar reasons, we are no longer recommending theMedical Guardian MGMoveandMedical Guardian MGMinias models worth considering. Though we did not retest these two devices, we did confirm with the call center that it uses the same automated voice system to answer all calls, unless you disable it. This isn\u2019t indicated anywhere on the website, nor was it communicated to us in our initial informational call.\n\nWith the Lively Mobile+ (now replaced by theLively Mobile2, which we didn\u2019t test), it was surprisingly difficult to converse with customer service by phone or by email, before and after we purchased the device. The device did not register anything during our fall-detection tests. And an on-call nurse service was supposed to be available for an additional fee, but since we could never reach customer service to set that up, we were unable to test the service.\n\nWe retestedLifeStation Sidekick Home, which we dismissed during our first round of testing, but our opinion hasn\u2019t changed. While the emergency operators for LifeStation continue to be great, the device simply wasn\u2019t as reliable or flexible as others we tested.\n\nUnlike the other systems we tested, theApple Watch Series 8andApple Watch SEdon\u2019t have a designated team of operators, so any emergency alerts go straight to 911. While in theory it\u2019s nice that the watches automatically enable fall detection for those over 55, it can lead to a lot of false alarms, particularly during activities like amusement-park rides and engaging in sports.\n\nThe aestheticTrelawear Sally Pendanthad reliable location tracking and response times consistently under a minute, but it also had a few key issues that made us dismiss it: It requires you to be very close (within 100 feet) to your cell phone at all times; it isn\u2019t waterproof; and it offers no way to cancel (or even notify you that you sent) an alarm. Its app was confusing, and it was different for Android and Apple phones.\n\nOne of the most appealing medical alert systems, from a caregiver perspective, isOneCare\u2019s CareWatch. It offers a lot of what you\u2019d expect from a medical alert smartwatch, such as fall detection. And it has a comfortable band (it proved to be one of the most accessible bands among those on watches we tested). Where it really stands out is its inclusion of an optional geofence and its frequently updated, highly accurate map. The geofence is a dignified alternative to door alarms for those caring for someone with memory challenges or dementia. And this device\u2019s ability to see whether the watch is charged and being worn allows even remote caregivers to have some extra peace of mind. OneCare offers a lot of promising features, but there are still a few too many wrinkles that need to be ironed out before we can recommend it. We\u2019re looking forward to giving it another try in our next round of tests.\n\nThe biggest advantage of Bay Alarm Medical Company\u2019sGetSafeis that it doesn\u2019t rely on a wearable component\u2014the only system besidesAlexa Emergency Assistto offer this option. GetSafe uses a series of wall buttons, pull cords, and voice activation in order to send an emergency alert. Strictly speaking, these methods all worked, and the system was reliable and responsive. But we found it confusing to set up and to use.\n\nTheMedEquip Alertis a compact, peanut-shaped device that works almost immediately after you plug it in to charge. It could be a good option for qualifying US military veterans, to whom the company provides the system for no out-of-pocket cost. The device was unnecessarily hard to purchase, but once we had it, the emergency agents were always pleasant and professional. Though the device offers fall detection, it did not detect any of our falls during testing, and we found pressing the alert button a little difficult.\n\nWe chose not to testMobileHelpandOne Call Alertbecause neither listed pricing information on their websites, and both required thorough contact information before they would provide information.\n\nWe liked a lot of aspects ofAloe Care Health\u2019s Essentials Hub. Yet ultimately we decided not to test it because of the limited range of its voice-activated base (and an inability to extend the range with more bases), as well as the higher price tag. We also considered, but ultimately decided not to test, theMobile Companion 2in this round because of its bulkier design and the need to take it off daily for charging.\n\nWe decided not to testAlert1andLifelineafter calling them as potential customers. Both engaged in aggressive sales tactics, such as adding pressure with \u201climited time deals\u201d and attempting to upsell unnecessary additions for the situation described. After making an anonymous customer call to Alert1, Anna received five phone calls, two voicemails, and four emails between the end of July and September. Lifeline proved to be one of the most predatory companies afterLife Alert; the sales representative was rude and resorted to scare tactics and guilt to try to make a sale.\n\nThis article was edited by Claire Perlman, Kalee Thompson, and Christine Cyr Clisset.\n\nRichard Milani, MD,chief clinical transformation officer at Ochsner Health System, phone interview, June 16, 2023\n\nJasun Fiorentino,developer of the MedEquip Alert, phone interviews, March 23, 2023, and June 14, 2023\n\nRegula H.

The stylish Kanega Watch includes 24/7 U.S.-based monitoring, fall detection, medication reminders ...", "date": "2025-06-05", "full_content": "The UnaliWear Kanega Watch is a more discreet alternative to traditional medical alert devices. The watch weighs 49 grams (about 1.7 ounces). It\u2019s 1.6 inches in diameter and 0.5 inches thick. It comes with a patented quick-swap battery, so you never have to take it off to charge.\n\nThe UnaliWear Kanega Watch is a stand-alone personal emergency response device, so you don\u2019t need a landline or cellphone to make it work. Instead, it relies on Verizon\u2019s nationwide cellular network. The watch connects to your home Wi-Fi but automatically switches to Verizon\u2019s network when you leave your home.\n\nYou can call for help in multiple ways. If you press and hold the button on the right side of the watch (called the crown button) for a couple of seconds, you\u2019ll be connected to the monitoring center. These trained professionals have your contact information and the names of your caregivers and know exactly whom to notify and where to dispatch help.\n\nYou can also use voice commands through the watch\u2019s built-in microphone. Finally, if you fall, the watch automatically detects the unusual movement and notifies the monitors.\n\nUnaliWear offers two different pricing structures for the Kanega Watch. You can make an upfront payment for the whole year, or you can pay monthly from the start. No matter how you pay, you have a one-time setup fee.\n\nAs of publishing, if you choose to pay monthly from the start, your one-time setup fee is $299. Then, you\u2019ll pay $69.95 a month for monitoring services.\n\nThere\u2019s no contract with either payment structure, so you can cancel the service anytime. But note that the watch and the accessories aren\u2019t yours to keep. You have to return everything in good condition if you cancel the monitoring service.\n\nDesigned with an older user in mind, the UnaliWear Kanega Watch has many features to help improve independence, including:\n\nCompare UnaliWear with othermedical alert companies.\n\nThe company name comes from the Cherokee words \u201cUnalii,\u201d which means friend, and \u201cKanega,\u201d which means speak. When you put them together, you have a friend who speaks to you.\n\nUnaliWear covers defects in materials and workmanship for as long as you have it, as long as you are current on your service payments. If any issues come up, UnaliWear will replace the watch for free.\n\nThe company also covers replacement and shipping at no cost the first time you break the watch. Be aware that UnaliWear does not cover replacement of a watch in all circumstances.\n\nAfter 30 days, you can cancel the service at any time as long as you return all equipment. You\u2019ll get a refund (minus a $75 restocking fee) if all equipment is returned in good condition. Annual plans will be issued a prorated refund based on the nondiscounted monthly rate of $69.95.\n\nTo cancel your monitoring service through UnaliWear, you need to call the company\u2019s customer support team. As a part of the cancellation, you must send the equipment back in good condition. A lost or damaged watch results in a fee of up to $650.\n\nThe company\u2019s headquarters is in Austin, Texas.\n\nUnaliWear helps vulnerable people enjoy more independence through its medical alert technology. The stylish Kanega Watch includes 24/7 U.S.-based monitoring, fall detection, medication reminders and a 30-day money-back guarantee. Since the watch uses Wi-Fi and LTE technologies, wearers don\u2019t need a landline to access help. In addition, UnaliWear doesn\u2019t require a long-term contract.\n\nShop with confidence\n\nCompare with top companies\n\nFilter by Rating\n\nPopular Mentions\n\nA link has directed you to this review. Its location on this page may change next time you visit.\n\nReviewed Sept. 17, 2024\n\nThe Kanega Watch has been a lifesaver for my grandma (and mom!). My grandma lives independently and is able to continue to do so because the Kanega provides round the clock coverage in the case of an emergency. And even better, my mom can rest easy, knowing she's safe. We chose the Kanega because the 24/7 monitoring service already knows who she is when an alert comes from the watch. After doing so much research online, we found that the Kanega's coverage and service was far superior to others on the market. Totally worth the price!\n\nReviewed March 12, 2024\n\nI bought this watch for my mother in December 2023. Two months later the screen went blank and it was not usable. I made several calls and wrote emails to the company's customer service department. The calls repeatedly were answered by the \"overflow\" service department, which was not qualified to actually troubleshoot problems. After a week of no response on how to fix the watch, I returned it. If you want a watch that detects falls and will notify emergency services, I would suggest an Apple Watch. The Apple Watch does everything the Kanega does and more, and it costs less.\n\nThanks for subscribing.\n\nYou have successfully subscribed to our newsletter! Enjoy reading our tips and recommendations.\n\nReviewed Feb. 17, 2024\n\nThe watch band was too large even though the wrist measured within the range for small. And the watch was heavy, too heavy for a small person to sleep when wearing. This may work better for larger folks, but if you're small, I would not recommend it. The $75 return fee is very steep and you need to go through customer service, which tries and tries to change your mind, to return it.\n\nReviewed Nov. 15, 2023\n\nWe got the Kanega Watch for my father several years ago. He loves it and he wears it all the time, which is the total point. The fall detection has worked as advertised, and he enjoys asking his watch for the time and date. Tremendous peace of mind for him and our whole family. I highly recommend!\n\nReviewed Oct. 22, 2023\n\nI purchased the watch on 9/6/2023, I received it around 9/11/2023. I lost a battery out of it on 10/2/2023, I had no idea how I lost it. Now on 10/22/2023 the watch band has broken where it attaches with the battery to watch. Very unhappy with the construction as I bought a battery for about $36 plus shipping about 3 weeks after purchase and now about 6 weeks later it is broken. I am emailing the company today to see what they will do about this situation. I paid $918.40. I would expect a better quality.\n\nReviewed Sept. 16, 2023\n\nThe service is great. There is very little set up and it is very easy to do. Once we received the watch there were 3 very short videos to watch and then you call the center and they do a test call with you. My Aunt loves the device because it isn't a pendant that gets in the way, flops around or looks out of place when she dresses up and goes out. She also likes the fact that she never has to take it off and can wear it in the shower.\n\nOur only complaint is that after only 3 months the first watch band broke where the battery goes in. We didn't realize it cracked and one battery was lost and then the band broke all together. I believe that a more rubberized battery chamber would be a better housing for the battery. The other disappointment was we had to pay $50 for shipping for a new watch. This seems a bit steep. We haven't found anything better at this time but the shipping cost did cause the luster of this product to dull somewhat.", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "BrainCheck", "title": "New and Real-World Research Supports BrainCheck's Cognitive Assessment and Care Planning Solutions", "url": "https://www.news-journal.com/new-and-real-world-research-supports-brainchecks-cognitive-assessment-and-care-planning-solutions/article_1bfb8a1c-4cbb-56ef-a362-15e133d9728e.html", "source": "Longview News-Journal", "body": "AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- BrainCheck, Inc. announced promising new and real-world data supporting BrainCheck's cognitive assessment and care planning solutions was recently ...", "date": "2023-11-12", "full_content": "Note: Content could not be properly extracted from this source.

This is the second patent in DERMALA's intellectual property portfolio that covers using the human microbiome to treat and prevent acne.\n\nAcneisthe most common skin condition that affectsover\u00a080% of adolescents. It often persists into adulthood with a negative impact on the quality of life. Acne vulgaris is characterized by microbiome dysbiosis associated with an overgrowth ofC. acnesbacteria, followed by inflammation of skin follicles. To date, many strategies have been used to treat acne. However, they often show limited efficacy accompanied by side effects, in part due to suboptimal delivery into the skin and lack of targeting.\n\nDERMALA developed a novel technology for enhanced targeted delivery of human microbiome-derived postbiotic metabolites into specific layers of the skin. This results in higher treatment efficacy due to targeted inhibition ofC. acnesin follicles and reducing inflammation while avoiding side effects.\u00a0The microbiome-derived postbiotics derived from beneficial bacteria help correct the microbiome dysbiosis associated with acne and produce faster and longer-lasting results.\n\n\"Targeted delivery is critical\u00a0for\u00a0overcoming side effects and achieving high treatment efficacy,\" said Dr. Lada Rasochova, founder and CEO of DERMALA. \"Granting of this patent recognizes the uniqueness of our delivery approach and further enhances the value of our microbiome technology as it allows for formulating microbiome-derived ingredients into specific, efficacious, and effective topical products\".\n\nThis patent is an important part of the fast-expanding DERMALA's intellectual property portfolio which focuses on using the human microbiome for improving skin health and treating skin conditions like acne and eczema.\n\nAbout DERMALADERMALA, Inc. is aSan Diego-based consumer dermatology company leveraging a scientific understanding of the human microbiome and data analytics to develop novel treatments for chronic skin conditions.

It was during this time that she realized how confusing maternal healthcare really is.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the things I was talking to my clients about \u2014 like the digital front door and how we build around patient-centered outcomes and multidisciplinary care models \u2014 were really absent when it came to my maternal care journey,\u201d Doyle said in an interview. \u201cThat made a big impression on me.\u201d\n\nBreak down the silos. Take control of your provider data.\n\nWhat was absent was care for needs other than actual pregnancy care, like mental health and physical therapy. Postpartum care was also seriously lacking. Drawing from her experience, Doyle went on to create Chicago-basedPartum Healthin 2020.Judges crowned Partum Health the winner of the consumer/employer track of theMedCity News INVEST Pitch Perfect conteston May 24, preferring it over four other companies.\n\nPartum Health, a direct-to-consumer company, supports families during fertility, pregnancy and postpartum. It currently only serves patients in Illinois, but is looking to expand nationally. It offers doula care (during birth and postpartum), lactation consultants, physical therapy, nutrition support, mental health services and acupuncture. Patients can meet with the care team in the provider\u2019s office, the patient\u2019s home or via telehealth. They can also chat with the care team through Partum\u2019s app.\n\n\u201cI think the reality is, if you want to have a great postpartum experience, you actually have to start planning and doing preventative care during your pregnancy,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cThen we also know that, for example, when people are in the midst of fertility treatments, there\u2019s a really high incidence of mental health challenges, and also nothing really built into that care delivery to bring mental health side-by-side with your fertility journey. There may also be instances where people need support with the physical side from [physical therapy], things like nutrition, that can really aid in supporting optimal fertility, pregnancy and postpartum.\u201d\n\nPartum Health was chosen as the winner of the Pitch Perfect contest because it is filling an \u201cunmet market need,\u201d said Shawn Ellis, managing partner ofDistributed Venturesand a judge for the contest.\n\nYour varicose or spider veins may indicate an underlying problem, so finding the right vein specialist is crucial. Discover the best vein clinics in Orlando.\n\n\u201cThere was a consensus that Partum is coordination of different specialist care that\u2019s really, really needed during pregnancy and post pregnancy,\u201d Ellis said. \u201c[I] loved the coordination of care, loved the very consumer-centric approach, patient-centric approach.\u201d\n\nWhile Partum is a direct-to-consumer company, it is in-network with Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Cigna for its clinical services. It functions in a fee-for-service model, in which clinical care is usually reimbursed through insurance and non-clinical services like doula care is paid out of pocket or through a health savings account or flexible spending account.Down the line, the company aims to engage in more payer relationships (including Medicaid), as well as work with employers.\n\nPartum has received interest from investors as well, raising a little over $1 million in a pre-seed round from angel investors. The startup is currently raising\u00a0its seed round.\n\nOther maternal health companies are gaining funding as well. Maven Clinic raised$90 millionin Series E funding in November. The company offers care including fertility, maternity and pediatric support. Oula \u2014 which provides midwifery, obstetrics and pregnancy education \u2014 raised more than$19 millionin January.\n\nPartum Health\u2019s ultimate goal is to expand the scope of what\u2019s considered needed in pregnancy care, Doyle said.\n\n\u201cOur aim is that every family \u2014 just like you see an obstetrician or you see a reproductive endocrinologist if you\u2019re going through fertility \u2014 they also have access to mental health and physical therapy and doula care,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the shift that we\u2019re trying to create. The default model really needs to be expanded to include these specialists because that\u2019s what the families are looking for. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to move the needle on the health complications and issues that people are experiencing today.\u201d\n\nPhoto: MedCity News", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Partum Health", "title": "Partum Health Coverage - MedCity News", "url": "https://medcitynews.com/tag/partum-health/", "source": "MedCity News", "body": "Partum Health, a maternal health startup, recently won the consumer/employer track of the MedCity News INVEST Pitch Perfect contest.

Today,Fort Health, a specialty outpatient pediatric mental health provider, announced that it has partnered withCollevato train its therapists with AI avatar-led, face-to-face simulations. By providing highly relevant and engaging customized scenarios, Fort Health is able to rapidly upskill its therapists using evidence-based therapeutic protocols, ultimately leading to improved client care and operational efficiency. The initial series of custom training scenarios resulted in 83% of clinicians feeling more prepared and 95% able to apply what they have learned.\n\nAbody of researchfrom the National Institute of Medicine shows that current efforts to train clinicians in empirically-based treatments (EBTs) face significant challenges, as they typically provide only didactic training with no examination of applied skills, follow-up support, or implementation feedback. Studies emphasize the importance of role-play skill practice and ongoing expert guidance to ensure clinicians maintain high fidelity to EBT protocols and deliver effective interventions to patients. Compounded by thebehavioral health care workforce shortage,these limitations underscore the need for innovative training approaches to address challenges in a cost-effective and scalable manner.\n\n\"AI-powered avatar simulations are revolutionizing therapist training by enabling immersive, risk-free practice of critical decision-making and patient interactions,\" saidNatalie Schneider, founding CEO of Fort Health. \"Colleva's AI coaching platform empowers us to design tailored, dynamic scenarios that mirror real-world challenges, providing therapists with hands-on experience in applying evidence-based treatment protocols. By leveraging AI patient avatars, we are transforming mental health training\u2014making it more proactive, personalized, and scalable to meet the growing demand for high-quality care.\"\n\nHow it Works\n\nUsing Fort Health's agentic AI training platform \u2013 which is modeled on the evidence-based treatment protocol, the Unified Protocol for children, adolescents, and caregivers \u2013 therapists conduct realistic role plays with custom avatars and receive personalized feedback to identify areas for improvement and highlight strengths. The series of interactive scenarios are a safe space to practice and develop therapeutic techniques. To help therapists build and demonstrate their proficiency, there are three scenarios representative of the patient population that Fort Health treats. Each of the scenario's avatars have six personalities to choose from, allowing for more realistic and varied practice. Each custom simulation uses generative AI to analyze both content and delivery. Personalized feedback is based on specific EBT objectives and CBT competency frameworks. Therapists are also provided instant feedback on soft skill competencies important to successful therapy outcomes.\n\n\"We are harnessing AI not to replace human therapists, but to make them more effective,\" saidMichael Palys, co-founder and president of Colleva. \"It's been wonderful working in partnership with the Fort Health team as they share our collective vision of using AI role plays and simulations to enhance human skills in areas like mental health where these skills are so critically important to successful patient outcomes. The ability to offer personalized 1:1 feedback at scale is a game changer. My father's own career in psychiatry has made this particular project very special to me, and it's been wonderful to see the excitement among practitioners.\"\n\n\"As a therapist, I know how challenging it can be to translate the professional training we receive into real life interactions with children and families. I also know how uncomfortable and anxiety provoking it can be for a therapist to participate in role plays or live observations. Having a private, safe space to fumble and trip as you sharpen your skill set is a game changer for most therapists,\" saidLindsay Henderson, PsyD, founding clinical director, Fort Health. \"Utilizing AI simulations as a training platform to increase therapist's ability to deliver EBT at a higher fidelity will be key to solving for our nation's youth mental health needs.\"\n\n\"What a unique training opportunity!

Jiminy's 2022. Carlson tells the story of Lauren, a millennial Jiminy's customer who refers to her dog Mordecai as \"her son.\"", "date": "2022-11-07", "full_content": "ByDavid Riemer,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nAnne Carlson, founder and CEO ofJiminy\u2019s, was two years into building her new, sustainable pet food company, before she was able to tell the story of why she created it. It turns out that the story was too emotional for Carlson to share in public. It was a classic \u201cpurpose story\u201d that began with an upsetting conversation Carlson had with her adult daughter about the future of our planet. The conversation was the \u201cinciting incident\u201d in her story that led the former Del Monte executive to tackle climate change by identifying new sources of protein for pet food\u2014starting with crickets. Since creating the company, Carlson and her team have raised $6 million in seed money, secured distribution in 1,100 Petco stores, built a direct-to-consumers business and generated millions in annual revenue. Now, as Carlson looks to raise a Series A to help dramatically scale the business, she has a new storytelling challenge.\n\nJiminy's CEO, Anne Carlson with her dogs Tuco (below) and Timber (above).\n\nBut this startup story starts with Carlson\u2019s origin story.\n\nWhile at Del Monte, Carlson helped aggregate and sell its pet food assets and rebrand them as Big Heart Pet Brands. In 2016, the J.M. Smucker Company bought the new pet brand, and Carlson moved on to think about her next thing. Around this time, Carlson had a conversation that most parents eventually have with their adult children about whether they hope to have kids one day. Carlson\u2019s daughter answered, \u201cno.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t want to bring them into a world that was devolving due to climate change. Carlson was heartbroken. She wished her daughter would experience the same joy she had raising a family. And she might have felt a bit guilty as well about not doing enough to change the narrative. Looking back, Carlson says, \u201cI realized that I couldn\u2019t just do a normal job after that\u2014building a better future for her was everything.\u201d\n\nBecause of Carlson\u2019s experience in the pet food business, she knew thatan estimated 25%-35%of domestic meat production was used to feed dogs and cats. Dogs alone consume 32 billion pounds of protein annually. The environmental impact of feeding pets in the U.S. is huge, because of the massive amount of land, water and feed required to raise cows and chickens. In researching alternatives, Carlson discovered that insects, especially crickets, are a tremendous source of protein that require a fraction of the resources required to produce traditional meat products. Cricket production, by example, generates 99% lessgreenhouse gasthan chicken production. Jiminy\u2019s was created to address this macro problem. In Carlson\u2019s early pitches, she focused on this big picture story.\n\nBut this is where things get more complicated and the real storytelling challenge emerges. The story that inspired Carlson to start the company is a memorable way to introduce Jiminy\u2019s, but to raise a series A, she must also convince investors that there\u2019s a massive market of pet owners willing to feed their dogs insect-based food. This is a common challenge for the founder who has a great origin story for their business. They\u2019ve told ustheirstory, but they\u2019ve yet to introduce the true protagonist in their product story. There has to be acustomerwith a set of needs that only Jiminy\u2019s can solve.\n\nThe good news for Carlson is that millennial and Gen Z pet owners are extraordinarily conscious of \u2014 and troubled by \u2014 the causes of climate change; and they\u2019re knowledgeable about emerging solutions. They also make-up nearly half the dog ownership in the U.S. Now Carlson has the protagonist for her new story.\n\nJiminy's Chewy Cricket Treat\n\nCarlson tells the story of Lauren, a millennial Jiminy\u2019s customer who refers to her dog Mordecai as \u201cher son.\u201d Lauren, like Carlson\u2019s daughter, is extremely worried about climate change so much so that she uses the \u201cgreener\u201d peer-to-peer videoconferencing solutionCrewdleinstead of Zoom for her work and non-profit board meetings. That\u2019s the big picture stuff. But when it comes to Mordecai, an adorable deaf rescue pup, Lauren\u2019s concerned about her dog\u2019s gut health. Mordecai isn\u2019t a lot of fun to be around, when suffering from stomach ailments. Lauren also wants meal options she can provide her pet throughout the day. Custom meal services are expensive and have way too much packaging. She\u2019d be delighted to try a more sustainable pet food, if it was healthy for the dog and came in different formats. Lauren\u2019s heard that insects are an emerging source of protein and she\u2019s willing to try something new.\n\nJiminy's expanding line-up of insect-based pet food.\n\nJiminy\u2019s answers the call. Jiminy\u2019s is asustainable pet foodusing insect protein. Once a customer like Lauren switches from a traditional meat-based pet food to Jiminy\u2019s, for example, it could save 200,000 to 2,000,000 gallons of water every year depending on the size of the dog and whether it had been eating chicken or beef based food (Jiminy\u2019s offers aneco-calculatorto figure this out). The food is nutritious, prebiotic and hypoallergenic. It includes fiber, iron, vitamin B2 and 12. And finally, Jiminy\u2019s offers a host of products from wet food to treats that can feed a dog throughout the day.\n\nFor her roadshow, Carlson will lead with her emotional origin story and quickly pivot to Lauren\u2019s story. Prospective investors will learn why Carlson is so passionate about creating a new pet brand to fight climate change, and why customers like Lauren are buying it. Lauren says, \u201csince switching (brands), Mordecai is a whole new dog. He's healthier, his fur is softer, his breath is better, and we can now breathe around him!\u201d And Lauren also feels like she\u2019s doing her part for the planet. It\u2019s a powerful one-two punch that Carlson hopes will help her raise an $8 million series A to expand her business and promote a healthier future one dog at a time.", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Jiminy's", "title": "Looking for a more sustainable dog food?

Producing all that food generates about \u200b\u200b64 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, not to mention the land, water, and other resources required to farm animals.\n\nAs pet ownership rises,Americans increasingly see their crittersas family members.

She started with cricket treats \u2014 which dogs went crazy for \u2014 then worked with scientists and veterinarians to determine if crickets and \u201cgrubs,\u201d or black soldier fly larvae, could provide complete nutrition for dogs. Studies showed that they could, and that the bugs also offered an array of compelling health benefits. (Her team is pursuing similar research for cats.) But Carlson was always looking at it from the angle of curbing emissions. For her, it was a personal matter.\n\nIn 2016, after a stint working for a big pet food company, Carlson was pondering her next move. A conversation with her then-college-aged daughter gave Carlson a new outlook on her career when her daughter said she didn\u2019t want to have kids. \u201cHer reason was she was worried about what the world was going to be like by the time they grew up,\u201d Carlson says. \u201cAnd she was talking about climate change.\u201d\n\nCarlson felt a pressing sense of responsibility to be part of creating a world in which her daughter would want to raise children. \u201cI actually decided right then that no matter what I did, it was going to be fighting climate change,\u201d she recalls. She founded Jiminy\u2019s later that year. Today, the company offers dry and wet dog food and treats made of insects; its products are available in around1,400 pet storesnationwide and online through popular retailers like Chewy. Although several other companies now offer insect protein treats, Jiminy\u2019s remains the only company in the U.S. selling bug-based dog food.\n\nWe talked to Carlson about her journey to bring a more sustainable form of protein to the pet market, and what she sees as the future of the industry. Her responses have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.Become one.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please considerdisabling your ad-blockerto allow ads on Grist.Here's How\n\nQ. Tell me about the Jiminy\u2019s origin story. How did you get the idea to launch an alt-protein company for pets?\n\nA.A little bit after that conversation [with my daughter], I got approached to lead a pet food company. They were framing it as a sustainable alternative for pets. It was grass-fed beef. I absolutely fell in love with this idea of sustainability and pets, but I was like, \u201cYou know what? Cows are never gonna be the answer.\u201d I started thinking, \u201cWhat could be a protein source that would be sustainable for pets? And could it be humane as well?\u201d Because that would be awesome. When you look at traditional protein, it\u2019s pretty terrible from a lot of different perspectives.\n\nI started throwing different types of protein sources onto a page. I actually put an insect on the page. I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know what inspired me to do it, but I kept coming back to it. Then I saw that theU.N. had done a studysaying that insects could be the answer to world hunger.\n\nI ordered roasted crickets online. When I got them, I fed them to my dogs to see what they would do. And the drool started right away. I knew I had something that was gonna work. When you think about a dog \u2014 I don\u2019t know, do you have a dog?\n\nQ. I do!\n\nA.You know if the drool starts, they\u2019re really loving something. And it was flowing freely. Of course, I had to try it, too. I tried the crickets \u2014 and they tasted good! It was a little scary the first time I put it in my mouth, but once you get past that, you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, it tastes like a sunflower seed.\u201d It\u2019s nutty, it\u2019s earthy. We were kind of off to the races at that point.\n\nQ. So you were inspired by the U.N. study about insects as a solution for human diets, and you translated that to pet food. How did that work?\n\nA.We started with the crickets, because they are the easiest to wrap your head around. We like to call them the gateway bug \u2014 but when you look at it, you can see it is a fantastic protein source. It has all of the amino acids that you need to be a complete protein. When you\u2019re working with dogs, you\u2019re looking for 10 essential amino acids, and this delivers it in the quantities that you need. So I knew it was a good protein source, but then you start digging into it and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, but it also has minerals and vitamins and fiber.\u201d All of these other things make it into even more than just a protein source. It really is a superfood.\n\nAnd what I loved about working with the dogs is that I felt like I could have a huge impact quickly, if I was able to make a food that was complete and balanced that they could eat every day. Because if you think about it, if I were to make something for people \u2014 like, say I make a breakfast bar. Best-case scenario, even if you ate it every single day, I\u2019d only be impacting about 7 percent of your eating occasions. But if I make a food for dogs, I can impact 80 to 90 percent of their eating occasions with one product.\n\nQ. That makes sense. Speaking of the impact, could you give me a quick rundown of some of the benefits of farming insects instead of livestock?\n\nA.You bet. It\u2019s kind of fun, actually. Let me just give you sort of an analogy here: If you had an acre of land and you put cows on it, at the end of a year, you\u2019re gonna get 192 pounds of protein. If you had chickens, you get 265 pounds of protein. But if you had crickets?Sixty-five thousandpounds of protein at the end of the year. And grubs, over a million pounds of protein. [Statistics come from alifecycle assessment by insect producer EnviroFlight.] And there\u2019s a lot of reasons why. They have a shorter lifespan. For crickets, it\u2019s approximately six weeks. They also reproduce at a super-high rate. So if you think about a cow, it\u2019s having one to two babies at a time and it takes nearly a year to gestate, but grubs are laying 500 eggs at a time.\n\n[Read more: Scientists are \u201cmilking\u201d microbes to create cow-free dairy products.]\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s really cool is that there\u2019s no waste. You\u2019re using the entire animal. They\u2019re roasted and ground and the entire animal is used. Even their bedding [and excrement] is used. That\u2019s what they call frass,which is this amazing fertilizer.\n\nQ. Jiminy\u2019s is a pioneer and remains the only U.S. company offering complete-diet dog food made from insect protein. What were some of the challenges getting started?\n\nA.The biggest challenge was proving that it was safe for the dogs. You could look at the nutritional analysis on it, but there was still a question as to whether or not the dogs could actually digest it. We worked with Iowa State andAnimalBiometo doa bunch of studies, and they were all published and peer reviewed. And all of that went into proving that it was safe to use in a food.\n\nWhen we started, we focused on treats. In order to do the food, we had to do all those studies \u2014 we knew it was really important to be able to prove that it was truly digestible and it had utility. And the great news is, what we found is that it is as digestible for dogs as chicken or beef. The other thing we were able to prove is that, because it\u2019s got that fiber that comes from the exoskeleton, that feeds the good bacteria in the dog\u2019s gut. It\u2019s also hypoallergenic \u2014 for dogs that have food allergies, oftentimes this is a great solve for them.\n\nQ. What has been the reaction from pet owners in the five years that Jiminy\u2019s products have been on the market?\n\nA.It\u2019s kind of funny, it\u2019s really shifted. At the beginning, when we would say we\u2019re making dog treats with cricket protein, almost always, it was like, \u201cWait, what?\u201d You\u2019d have to explain that cricket protein is a thing. Now, people are like, \u201cOh, cool, I\u2019ve heard of that!\u201d And sometimes they\u2019ll ask us, \u201cOh, were you onShark Tank?\u201d Because there were a couple of companies making [insect-based] products for peopleonShark Tank\u2014 and we\u2019re like, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not us! But yeah, it\u2019s like that!\u201d\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s really shifted is, during the pandemic, more people adopted pets. And the people who adopted pets had more time to research what they were going to give to their pets \u2013 what kind of food. And one of the other things that\u2019s been happening is pet ownership is starting to shift younger and younger, which is great for us. Millennials and Gen Zare closing in on 50 percent of the pet ownershipin the U.S. \u2014 and they just get it. When we say we\u2019re working with insect protein, they\u2019re like, \u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d And when we talk about the sustainability, they\u2019re like, \u201cYes, that\u2019s important to me.\u201d When we say we\u2019re reducing the carbon pawprint, it just makes sense. They know what we\u2019re talking about.\n\nQ. What\u2019s your vision for where the pet industry could be in 10, 20, or 30 years?\n\nA.It needs to change so much. There needs to be sustainability across the board. I do see some great things that are happening in certain areas. Petco now has this [refill option] for cat litter; you can actually bring your own container and scoop the litter into your own container and take it away, rather than getting another plastic container. I think that\u2019s a great example of innovation in another category within pets. But I\u2019d love to see rethinking of the materials that are used for leashes and collars. I mean, think about going into one of those superstores and how many different types of products there are, and then think about how much plastic there is. We need to get away from these materials that can\u2019t be reused or recycled. And I\u2019d like to see other proteins being used that are sustainable as well \u2014 getting away from the cow and the chicken that is just so problematic.\n\nQ. What about your daughter? Has she shared her thoughts on the company, and how your vision has impacted her?\n\nA.She hasn\u2019t said absolutely that she wants to have kids, but she\u2019s more open to the idea than she was before. I think there\u2019s more hope. She sees what we\u2019re doing, she sees what others are doing. And we\u2019re trying to [approach sustainability] not just from the products that we make, but we\u2019re trying to make sure that everything we do is moving in the right direction. We\u2019re moving our packaging to sustainable packaging. We\u2019re offsetting [our shipping] by planting trees.We planted over 65,000 trees already. Everything that we do, we try to put it through the lens of, is this the best solution? Is this the best answer, when we think about climate change?\n\nRead more from theClimate Future Cookbook:\n\nA message from\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.
