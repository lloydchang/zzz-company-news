The company on Thursday confirmed a tender offer where investors will buy up shares from those employees at a valuation of $91.5 billion. Stripe said it will also repurchase shares as part of the transaction. A spokesperson declined to say who is in the secondary round except to confirm that it is \u201clargely\u201d existing investors. Past backers of the company number at over 150 investors per PitchBook data . They include General Catalyst, GV, Silver Lake, Atomico, Elon Musk, Salesforce and many more. The tender offer is a decent jump on the company\u2019s valuation from its last secondary sale a year ago, which was valued at $70 billion . However, Stripe still fell short of its high-watermark $95 billion valuation back in 2021. That round came at a time when e-commerce itself was booming due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it made Stripe, at the time and only on paper, the most valuable privately-held tech company in the world. The news coincides with Stripe\u2019s annual letter penned by CEO and co-founder Patrick Collison, which noted that payment volume in 2024 grew to $1.4 trillion, up 38% on the year before. It\u2019s a big number for Stripe, but to put it into some context, Visa said that its payment volume for 2024 was $13.2 trillion. The margin that Stripe makes on transactions (which are what make up payment volume) remains thin, and so this business remains one where it still has room to (and needs to) scale. Stripe also added that it is now used by half of the Fortune 100 companies, underscoring how it has catapulted from a startup working with other startups, into a major enterprise player. The tender offer was originally reported to be in the works earlier this month .

Generate Key Takeaways Tapestry\u2019s Coach has filed a suit against the fast-fashion specialist Shein for trademark counterfeiting, federal trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair competition. The 30-page complaint was filed on Thursday in the U.S. District Court in the Central District of California by Tapestry Inc., Coach Services Inc. and Coach IP Holdings against Zoetop Business Co. and Shein U.S. Services. A juried trial is being sought. More from WWD Trump's Tariffs: The Hot-button Topic at AAFA Executive Summit in D.C. Jewelry Designer Pamela Love Sues Alex and Ani Beneficial Owners for Unpaid Consulting Fees and Sales Royalties Chanel and What Goes Around Comes Around Hear Final Judgment for Infringement Case Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The suit alleges that Shein used commerce marks that are \u201cidentical or substantially indistinguishable or confusingly similar to Coach trademarks in connection with the sale, distribution and/or advertising\u201d of the alleged counterfeit products. The allegations include that when one searches for \u201ccoach\u201d on Shein\u2019s e-commerce site, there is \u201cno indication\u201d that any of the products originated from a third-party seller. When a shopper selects \u201cwhat appears to be legitimate \u2018 Coach \u2019 product for purchase, the third-party seller\u2019s information is so small and inconspicuous that the shopper could \u201creasonably believe\u201d that Shein was the seller with title or possession of the product. Attorneys for Tapestry and Coach did not respond immediately Tuesday afternoon to requests for comment, nor did an attorney for Shein. Representatives at both companies also had not returned media requests as of Tuesday afternoon. Designer dupes and fake fashion items are an ongoing issue for major brands. Nearly seven in 10 consumers were deceived into buying counterfeit products online at least once in 2023, according to research by Michigan State University\u2019s College of Communication Arts and Sciences. Less than two years ago, the U.S. Congress passed the Integrity, Notification and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers Act to better inform consumers about third-party sellers and to reduce the number of fake and stolen goods that are sold online. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The complaint features multiple pages with photographs of the alleged counterfeit Coach products including tote bags, handbags, shoes, hats and purses. Tapestry alleges that Shein made, marketed and sold knockoff items that used the Coach name, logos, hardware and signature \u201cC\u201d designs. The products highlighted in the legal complaint were items that were sold through Shein\u2019s marketplace platform, which allows third-party users to post product listings. Describing the \u201cworld of Chinese marketplaces\u201d as a bit like the wild west, Neil Saunders, managing director for retail at GlobalData, said \u201cit is hardly surprising that Tapestry wants to use the law as a taming influence. The complaint is legitimate inasmuch as Coach dupes are sold on Shein, and it\u2019s almost impossible for the consumer to understand exactly what they\u2019re buying. That\u2019s detrimental to the Coach brand.\u201d While it remains to be seen how the courts \u201cinterpret the technicalities of the law as the goods are sold by third parties rather than directly by Shein,\u201d Saunders said, \u201cCoach is trying to hold Shein fully liable. If they win, it will be a big victory for brands and will force Shein to take tough action on dupes and counterfeits.\u201d Like its archrival in the fast-fashion sector Temu, Shein is facing multiple suits that have been brought forward by established brands and little-known artists for trademark infringement and counterfeit goods. The Tapestry-Shein legal action comes at a time when President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is trying to stop ultra-cheap imports from entering the U.S. without tariffs.

Its growth numbers look impressive, and its AI platform is gaining traction across industries. Yet not everyone is convinced. Some investors still hesitate due to the stock\u2019s high price, its history of sharp swings, insiders\u2019 selling shares , and the Pentagon declaring Budget cuts that will impact Palantir\u2019s bottom line, as more than half of its revenue stems from defense contracts.

Despite its steady rise \u2013 its stock is up 15% year-to-date \u2013 Palantir has yet to fully overcome analysts\u2019 doubts about its ability to maintain this pace. Nevertheless, one analyst from William Blair thinks Palantir\u2019s recent move to partner with its foe, Databricks, is a game-changer. Palantir and Databricks Join Hands Last week, the company made a move that could change the game. Palantir partnered with Databricks, another big name in AI-driven data analytics. The two companies have often been seen as rivals, but now they\u2019re working together to make their platforms more compatible. This isn\u2019t a full merger of their tools, and they won\u2019t be selling a joint product. Instead, they\u2019re making it easier for businesses to use both systems side by side. Louie DiPalma, an analyst at William Blair, weighed in on the move, noting that while Palantir and Databricks compete in some areas, they rarely go head-to-head for contracts. The market, he said, is big enough for both. More importantly, the partnership makes sense for customers. \u201cSince there are now many joint users, it makes sense for both of their data platforms to work nicely with each other,\u201d he explained. Beyond commercial clients, the partnership could also be key in the government sector. The U.S. government recently issued an order requiring agencies to adopt better tracking systems for payments. Palantir, with its reputation for handling high-security data, stands to benefit. Working with Databricks strengthens its position as a go-to choice for agencies needing powerful AI tools. For Palantir, this partnership could be a turning point. It expands its reach, enhances its platform, and makes it more competitive against tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL) (GOOG) . However, the big question remains: will this be enough to finally convince skeptical investors that Palantir\u2019s rise is just getting started? Is PLTR a Buy, Hold, or a Sell? Turning to Wall Street, Palantir is considered a Hold. The average price target for PLTR stock is $94.27 , implying a 7.92% upside potential.
