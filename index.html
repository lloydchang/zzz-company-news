It also looks more like a digital watch than a medical alert device.FEATURED PARTNER OFFERWe receive compensation from our partners for Featured Partner Offer placements.

She retired after selling two other companies she founded, but she was inspired to rejoin the workforce to address problems faced by her mother, who was active but frail and wanted to age in place safely.\n\n\u201c[S]ome of the best stuff I think gets created because of the need, and needs are just not being met in silver tech,\u201d says Booth, noting that none of themedical alert systemsavailable in 2013 would have worked for her mother (theApple Watchdidn\u2019t hit store shelves until April 2015). \u201cThependantis super stigmatizing. And the problem is even with a pendant, you take it off at night because of the threat of choking. Yet the number one cause of injury among older adults is falls\u2014mostly in the bathroom and mostly at night,\u201d explains Booth. \u201cWe realized we could build a watch that you could wear 24/7.\u201d\n\nThe UnaliWear Kanega Watch is disguised discreetly as a digital wristwatch to avoid the potential stigma of wearing a medical alert device. It can interact with the wearer via voice, a push button and large white-on-black text on its screen. The watch is water-resistant, so users can wear it in the shower, although it\u2019s not recommended for swimming. The watch comes with four rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which can be swapped in and out without taking off the watch.\n\nWhen users first receive the watch, they provide UnaliWear with any relevant medical information.\n\nThe watch connects to the internet and an emergency response operator via Wi-Fi and runs exclusively on the Verizon 4G/5G cellular network nationwide. If an emergency occurs, (the user falls or calls for help), the watch\u2019sGPScan help locate them. It also connects them to an emergency response operator in seconds.\n\nUnaliWear\u2019s emergency response center is a U.S.-based, third-party provider that\u2019s Five Diamond certified by TMA, the monitoring industry\u2019s highest standard. The operators have each customer\u2019s provided medical information on hand to help determine what kind of help should be sent when they receive a call.\n\nTo start talking to the Kanega Watch, say, \u201cFred Astaire,\u201d and give it a command.\n\nSince no two people share identical falling patterns, the watch uses artificial intelligence (AI) to learn about each user\u2019s movements. If the watch detects what might be a fall and the wearer tells the alert center that they didn\u2019t fall, the AI learns to ignore similar movements of that user in the future.\n\nThe watch face includes a black screen with white text and comes in three accent colors: rose gold, champagne gold and black. Each watch strap is black no matter the accent color selected.\n\nUnaliWear offers two monitoring subscription options for the Kanega Watch: the annual plan and the monthly plan.\n\nFor the annual plan, users pay for device setup and 12 months of service upfront. Costs include a $199 one-time setup fee and$59.95 per month for ongoing monitoring and service. The total upfront cost is $918.40.\n\nFor the monthly plan, users pay for device setup and the first month of service upfront. Costs include a $299 one-time setup fee and$69.95 for one month of monitoring service, totaling $368.95 upfront.", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "BrainCheck", "title": "New and Real-World Research Supports BrainCheck's Cognitive Assessment and Care Planning Solutions", "url": "https://www.news-journal.com/new-and-real-world-research-supports-brainchecks-cognitive-assessment-and-care-planning-solutions/article_1bfb8a1c-4cbb-56ef-a362-15e133d9728e.html", "source": "Longview News-Journal", "body": "AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- BrainCheck, Inc. announced promising new and real-world data supporting BrainCheck's cognitive assessment and care planning solutions was recently ...", "date": "2023-11-12", "full_content": "Note: Content could not be properly extracted from this source.

By being able to visualize one\u2019s heart rate and breathing, users can learn to regulate their nervous system. The company has gone through several clinical trials, received a grant from the National Institutes of Health and also participated in Y Combinator.\n\nDuring COVID-19, Flowly saw an influx in providers interested in its product\u2014for use on themselves, co-founder and CEO Celine Tien told Fierce Healthcare. They were also eager to receive information about innovative ways to use pain management and anxiety therapies. \u201cThe problem with our healthcare model today is that so many providers live in their own silos,\u201d Tien said.\n\nTo help bridge gaps in knowledge, Flowly created a founding board of physicians, with 15 active members, where they share creative ways of using Flowly in practice. Members of the board also get access to the latest research, data and features from Flowly and can offer feedback to improve the product. Some members also work with Flowly to design lectures on their domain expertise. Nearly all members of the board have used Flowly themselves, Tien said.\n\nJaimee Arnoff, Ph.D., a licensed clinical psychologist specializing in young adults, initially heard about Flowly on a podcast. As someone with chronic pain, Arnoff reached out to try the product. \u201cAs a provider, I always love to try any app,\u201d Arnoff told Fierce Healthcare, especially one she might suggest to her clients.\n\nAfter using Flowly for a few months, she was convinced it was worth recommending to her patients as an option. \u201cIt was great to kind of focus on something so all-consuming,\u201d Arnoff said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful; it\u2019s relaxing.\u201d\n\nPatients can use Flowly before, during or after a treatment session to help calm their nervous system. \u201cThere are many days with clients where we are asking them to lean into this very uncomfortable place,\u201d Arnoff said. \u201cFlowly is a great way to kind of debrief and kind of come down from a heightened state of emotional or physical state that we might find ourselves in together.\u201d\n\nSome of Arnoff\u2019s patients buy Flowly for their personal use outside of treatment sessions.\n\nFlowly currently has more than 10,000 users and is so far used by more than 100 providers.", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Flowly", "title": "Sponsored App Review: Flowly - Android Headlines", "url": "https://www.androidheadlines.com/2014/02/sponsored-app-review-flowly.html", "source": "Android", "body": "Description: Flowly (which some of you might have known as Android Hub) is an Android app that's quite literally, all about Android.

It\u2019s essentially a self-contained RSS reader that\u2019s full of the best Android news sites, enabling you to keep up to date about all things Android. We\u2019re included in the list of news sources, as are Android Central, Android Police and the XDA Portal. It\u2019s a tablet-optimized app as well, making it perfect for those times when all you want to do is read about Android in leisure on that nice big Galaxy Note 12.2 you\u2019re waiting custom ROMs to appear on. With a night theme, and more available in the Pro version, Flowly is an essential app to keep on top of news if you\u2019re an Android enthusiast. The question is of course, how good an app is Flowly?\n\nHow it Works:After a quick download fromthe Play Store\u2013 of which there\u2019s also aPro versionwith added features \u2013\u00a0you\u2019re able to start using Flowly as you would any other app.\n\nAfter taking a look at what\u2019s new with the app, you\u2019re sent straight to the list of Android news on tap. With sites on the left and all the newest news on the right-hand side of the display.\n\nThe app can be used in portrait as well, and looks particularly nice on KitKat devices in its dark night theme.\n\nThere\u2019s a YouTube portal as well, which easily gets you to the channels of all the included Android sites. Which is great for when new devices comes out and you want to drool over some unboxings.\n\nOpinion:Flowly, is a great app for those that are looking to get hold of Android news and content. After all, that is the app\u2019s sole purpose and it fulfills that brilliantly. It looks great on tablets and the whole app is nice and smooth. The Pro version is well worth looking into as well, as it has a number of added features and isn\u2019t all that expensive. Where or not Flowly is an app for you depends on how interested in Android you are, if you\u2019re a die-hard fan then you need to install this app. For keeping abreast of all the most important Android news out there, Flowly is the app to go with. Sure, you could create a an RSS feed with all of your favorite Android sites, but that takes time and not everyone has the patience for that. Apps like Appy Geek are good alternatives, but again they\u2019re not as focused and can feel cluttered.\n\nRatings\n\nPros\n\nCons\n\nConclusion:Flowly is one of those apps that any Android enthusiast really ought to have installed. It\u2019s certainly not perfect, but it fulfills what it sets out to do very well and there are no glaring issues with the app. Sure, on the surface it\u2019s just an RSS app full of Android feeds. What if that\u2019s all you really need though? It\u2019s a very efficient way of grouping all of this news together and the developer also manages to avoid bias, too. While it would be nice to be able to add custom feeds in the app, I can understand why it\u2019s not included right now and someone like myself can certainly see the appeal of some quality curation such as this. Flowly is a good app for those that are heavily involved in Android.", "extraction_status": "success"}, {"company": "Rosy Wellness", "title": "Dar\u00e9 Bioscience and Rosy Wellness Announce Strategic Collaboration to ...", "url": "https://www.morningstar.com/news/globe-newswire/9462961/dar-bioscience-and-rosy-wellness-announce-strategic-collaboration-to-educate-and-market-dars-dare-to-play-sildenafil-cream", "source": "Morningstar", "body": "Rosy Wellness is a multi-award winning app recommended by 8,000+ healthcare professionals .

Dar\u00e9\u2019s ability to enter into and maintain third-party collaborations to facilitate access to the solutions Dar\u00e9 intends to bring to market as compounded drugs or consumer health products and Dar\u00e9\u2019s reliance on those third parties;

Dar\u00e9\u2019s ability to develop, obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for, and commercialize its product candidates and to do so on communicated timelines; failure or delay in starting, conducting and completing clinical trials of a product candidate and the inherent uncertainty of outcomes of clinical trials;

the risk that the FDA, other regulatory authorities, members of the scientific or medical communities or investors may not accept or agree with Dar\u00e9\u2019s interpretation of or conclusions regarding data from clinical studies of its product candidates; the risk that development of a product candidate requires more clinical or nonclinical studies than Dar\u00e9 anticipates; the loss of, or inability to attract, key personnel; the risk that developments by competitors make Dar\u00e9\u2019s product or product candidates less competitive or obsolete;

(KFSN) --The simple act of walking can be challenging for those living with Parkinson's disease, which affects movement.\n\nHowever, a Clovis veteran is now on the move with the help of a newly-invented device.\n\n\"It feels like your feet are stuck in cement,\" explained Patrick Hallmark. \"A lot of people who have Parkinson's, you'd be going through a doorway or whatever, and your feet -- you just cannot move your feet.\"\n\nThe 63-year-old has a condition called \"Freezing of Gait,\" which can come with Parkinson's.\n\nIt can lead to falls and hospitalizations.\n\nFor Hallmark, it also came with a loss of independence.\n\n\"If I didn't have my wife or daughter with me, I would really have a hard time out going to stores and everything,\" he said.\n\nThat's all changed with a device as small as his palm.\n\n\"This has done wonders,\" Hallmark said, as he shows his NexStride device.\n\nThrough a Parkinson's support group, Hallmark learned about NexStride and immediately bought the device.\n\nNow he's walking, despite his condition.\n\nSidney Collin, CEO of De Oro Devices, explained why walking can be hard for people with Freezing of Gait.\n\n\"There's a disconnect between the brain and the body, and it makes it so that when the brain is sending that signal to initiate movement, it doesn't get to the motor neurons that are activating the muscles,\" she said.\n\nCollin, a biomedical engineer, created NexStride for a veteran while she was in college.\n\nThe device essentially uses the same visual and auditory signals or cues used in physical therapy.\n\n\"The visual cue that we use is a green laser line projected onto the floor in front of you. The auditory cue is a metronome,\" she explained. \"So you visualize yourself stepping over that green laser line, stepping to the beat of the metronome. Just by changing the intention behind the movement, by setting that goal, we're changing the part of the brain that's been activated, that allows someone to be able to restore mobility.\"\n\nCollin is happy to see NexStride restoring mobility for people like Hallmark.\n\n\"I am able to walk or take my dog for walks,\" Hallmark said. \"I'm able to get out and go shopping, grocery shopping for my wife -- just do different things like that.\"\n\nThe device is $499 and it's 100% covered for veterans through Veterans Affairs, as well as the Parkinson's Wellness Fund organization.", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Partum Health", "title": "INVEST Pitch Perfect Spotlight: How Partum Health Is Working To ...", "url": "https://medcitynews.com/2023/06/maternal-healthcare-postpartum-birth-fertility/", "source": "MedCity News", "body": "Partum Health, a direct-to-consumer company, supports families during fertility, pregnancy and postpartum.

It was during this time that she realized how confusing maternal healthcare really is.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the things I was talking to my clients about \u2014 like the digital front door and how we build around patient-centered outcomes and multidisciplinary care models \u2014 were really absent when it came to my maternal care journey,\u201d Doyle said in an interview. \u201cThat made a big impression on me.\u201d\n\nBreak down the silos. Take control of your provider data.\n\nWhat was absent was care for needs other than actual pregnancy care, like mental health and physical therapy. Postpartum care was also seriously lacking. Drawing from her experience, Doyle went on to create Chicago-basedPartum Healthin 2020.Judges crowned Partum Health the winner of the consumer/employer track of theMedCity News INVEST Pitch Perfect conteston May 24, preferring it over four other companies.\n\nPartum Health, a direct-to-consumer company, supports families during fertility, pregnancy and postpartum. It currently only serves patients in Illinois, but is looking to expand nationally. It offers doula care (during birth and postpartum), lactation consultants, physical therapy, nutrition support, mental health services and acupuncture. Patients can meet with the care team in the provider\u2019s office, the patient\u2019s home or via telehealth. They can also chat with the care team through Partum\u2019s app.\n\n\u201cI think the reality is, if you want to have a great postpartum experience, you actually have to start planning and doing preventative care during your pregnancy,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cThen we also know that, for example, when people are in the midst of fertility treatments, there\u2019s a really high incidence of mental health challenges, and also nothing really built into that care delivery to bring mental health side-by-side with your fertility journey. There may also be instances where people need support with the physical side from [physical therapy], things like nutrition, that can really aid in supporting optimal fertility, pregnancy and postpartum.\u201d\n\nPartum Health was chosen as the winner of the Pitch Perfect contest because it is filling an \u201cunmet market need,\u201d said Shawn Ellis, managing partner ofDistributed Venturesand a judge for the contest.\n\nHealthcare is drowning in chaos\u2014from scattered data to burnout-inducing tasks. Discover how smarter workflows and real-time insights can rescue care teams and transform patient outcomes.\n\n\u201cThere was a consensus that Partum is coordination of different specialist care that\u2019s really, really needed during pregnancy and post pregnancy,\u201d Ellis said. \u201c[I] loved the coordination of care, loved the very consumer-centric approach, patient-centric approach.\u201d\n\nWhile Partum is a direct-to-consumer company, it is in-network with Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Cigna for its clinical services. It functions in a fee-for-service model, in which clinical care is usually reimbursed through insurance and non-clinical services like doula care is paid out of pocket or through a health savings account or flexible spending account.Down the line, the company aims to engage in more payer relationships (including Medicaid), as well as work with employers.\n\nPartum has received interest from investors as well, raising a little over $1 million in a pre-seed round from angel investors. The startup is currently raising\u00a0its seed round.\n\nOther maternal health companies are gaining funding as well. Maven Clinic raised$90 millionin Series E funding in November. The company offers care including fertility, maternity and pediatric support. Oula \u2014 which provides midwifery, obstetrics and pregnancy education \u2014 raised more than$19 millionin January.\n\nPartum Health\u2019s ultimate goal is to expand the scope of what\u2019s considered needed in pregnancy care, Doyle said.\n\n\u201cOur aim is that every family \u2014 just like you see an obstetrician or you see a reproductive endocrinologist if you\u2019re going through fertility \u2014 they also have access to mental health and physical therapy and doula care,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the shift that we\u2019re trying to create. The default model really needs to be expanded to include these specialists because that\u2019s what the families are looking for. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to move the needle on the health complications and issues that people are experiencing today.\u201d\n\nPhoto: MedCity News", "extraction_status": "success"}, {"company": "Partum Health", "title": "Partum Health Coverage - MedCity News", "url": "https://medcitynews.com/tag/partum-health/", "source": "MedCity News", "body": "Partum Health, a maternal health startup, recently won the consumer/employer track of the MedCity News INVEST Pitch Perfect contest.

Read my full review to find out why its personalized experience, user-friendly sign-up ...", "date": "2024-11-18", "full_content": "When you have social anxiety, counseling itself is a form of exposure therapy. My oldest son is 16 and has been dealing with symptoms ofsocial anxietyandobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)for about two years. He\u2019s been under the care of a psychiatrist, but none of the online therapy we\u2019ve tried has seemed to stick. Speaking with a counselor adds to his anxiety: On days when he has an appointment, he\u2019ll spend the hours leading up to it stressing and fretting.\n\nHe\u2019s tried two large mainstream online therapy platforms, chosen because he could communicate with the therapist via live chat during sessions or message a therapist without having set appointment times. These services didn\u2019t seem to help him very much, and he never wanted to continue with them for longer than a month or so. Chat and messaging may be less intimidating ways to communicate with a counselor, but they also make it harder for the patient and therapist to get to know each other.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\nSo, for the sake of this review, I convinced my teen to try Fort Health, even though it only offers more traditional face-to-face video therapy sessions. Fort Health provides online therapy and psychiatry/medication management for people ages 4 to 24 in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Caregiver coaching services are also available. We tested Fort Health\u2019s child therapy services for nearly a month. This is how it went.\n\nFort Health\u2019s services are covered by most major insurance plans, including Optum, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Cigna, Evernorth, Oxford Health Plans, Horizon BlueCross BlueShield, Geisinger Health Plan, and Humana. Medicaid is not accepted.\n\nOther plans may also be accepted; contact Forth Health customer service to confirm your coverage. If your plan is accepted, you\u2019ll only pay a copay or coinsurance payment. I paid the standard copayment for specialists on my insurance plan, which is $50.\n\nIf paying out of pocket, the company uses the pay-per-appointment model; there are no subscriptions or bundling options. Therapy is $180 for the initial evaluation session and $150 for subsequent 55-minute sessions. Psychiatry is $400 for the initial 60-minute evaluation and $200 for each 30-minute follow-up session. The caregiver coaching course is $149 for two 30-minute sessions and 10 short video lessons. The site asserts that if the caregiver course is undertaken as an addition to your child\u2019s therapy, it may be covered by your insurance plan.\n\nTo sign up for service at Fort Health, I simply clicked on the teal \u201cFind Care Now\u201d button on the homepage. This opens a new tab and begins a series of questions.\n\nFirst it asks who you are seeking care for, with two choices: \u201cI am a caregiver scheduling care for my child\u201d or \u201cI am between 18 and 24, looking for care for myself.\u201d I appreciated this distinction because I\u2019ve signed up for online therapy services for my son before where the platform assumed I was the person seeking care. That meant there was no separate portal for me to log into as a parent, which felt intrusive to my son\u2019s privacy in a way that might hamper his ability to speak freely with the therapist.\n\nNext I was prompted to choose among the three states where Fort Health is available: New York, New Jersey, or Pennsylvania. It also asked me to indicate my child\u2019s age group: child, tween, teen, or young adult. This helped the service match my son with a provider with experience and expertise in the appropriate age group.\n\nSeveral questions ask about what brings your child into therapy. I had the option to choose as many items as applicable from options like school problems, anxiety, depression, attention difficulties, disruptive behavior, grief, unhealthy screen behaviors, sleep issues, trauma, body image, autism, social issues, and substance misuse. It also asks if any of these situations apply to the child within the previous six months: mental health-related hospitalization, suicide attempt, violent behavior resulting in safety concerns for them or others, disordered eating, using someone else\u2019s prescription medication or taking too much of their own medication, having excessive energy to the point of rarely sleeping, or hearing or seeing things others don\u2019t.\n\nThen I was asked whether I was seeking therapy, medication management, or both. At that point, I was able to search for my insurance plan and enter those details. I also submitted a photo of the front and back of my health insurance card so Fort Health could begin the process of confirming my insurance.\n\nI then filled in open-ended questions about my availability. The service needed a time when my son and I were available for an initial therapy evaluation session and for our ongoing weekly availability for a regular session. It explained that my son would attend therapy on his own, so this availability should be his. The service then worked to pair my son with a provider who had an open slot that aligned with my son\u2019s availability so he could continue to have a session at the same time each week.\n\nFinally, I was asked to enter my name, contact information, and preferred communication form and then schedule a time to receive a call from an intake coordinator to book the first appointment and discuss my son\u2019s therapist match. Call slots were available on weekdays at various times between 10 a.m. and 2:45 p.m. as soon as the following business day, but I could also choose to schedule it several weeks or months out if needed. I booked one for within a few days. The entire sign-up process took about 15 minutes.\n\nUpon completion of the sign-up process, I received an email welcoming me to the Fort Health community. It included a link to a short informational video by the company\u2019s clinical director. It also said, \u201cTo get started with care, call this number.\u201d I was a little confused by this since I was told the next step would be to receive a scheduled call from the company, not make a call. I didn\u2019t call the number and was contacted by the intake representative at the scheduled time, so I guess it wasn\u2019t necessary. Still, I appreciated this more personalized email confirmation of signing up for a service consultation.\n\nThe intake coordinator called me promptly at the scheduled time. They were friendly and helpful and seemed happy to answer any questions I had. She said Fort Health had five therapists and two psychiatrists licensed in Pennsylvania and accepting of UnitedHealthcare insurance, though two of these therapists were not accepting new clients at the moment.\n\nShe matched us with a therapist who had ongoing weekly availability during the weekday afternoon time slot I indicated on the sign-up form. The intake coordinator didn\u2019t tell me about her licensure or credentials, and I forgot to ask. Her public profile on the Fort Health site only says she is an LMHC (licensed mental health counselor) and licensed child therapist. Most of the providers advertised on the site are LMHCs, licensed professional counselors (LPCs), or licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs). The site also employs MDs and psychiatric nurse practitioners to provide psychiatry and medication services.\n\n[4]\n\nThe intake coordinator told me she was sending over paperwork that I would need to complete at least 48 hours ahead of the appointment. Appointments are available as late as 7:30 p.m. on weekdays, and client services can be reached until 6:30 p.m. Of course, because this is a child therapy service, afternoon and evening times are highly popular during the school year.\n\nI received an email immediately after this call confirming my appointment for the initial therapy evaluation. There were two big blue buttons to click on to either join the video session or set up our account. I also received an email that our insurance was confirmed.\n\nI then set up our account in the patient portal, filled in the necessary intake paperwork, and input my payment information for copays. I entered my son\u2019s contact and biographical information, such as date of birth, gender, etc. I was pleased to see the diverse gender identification options: Female, Male, Trans Man, Trans Woman, Genderqueer, Other, or Choose Not to Disclose. I then answered a series of open-ended questions about my son\u2019s mental health and medical history, such as any medications he\u2019s currently taking and any previous experience with therapy. I was also asked to share my concerns relating to my son\u2019s mental health. I appreciated that these sections were all fillable boxes rather than multiple choice.\n\nNext, I signed the consent for disclosure for minors form indicating my agreement to allow the therapist to share notes with my son\u2019s primary care provider. This is recommended, but it\u2019s not required. Then came the cancellation policy, which noted that patients who do not cancel at least 48 hours prior to\u00a0their appointment or who do not show up to their appointment will be charged a $90 fee.\n\nFinally came Fort Health\u2019s contact information and virtual therapy guidelines, such as how to help your child prepare for therapy sessions and the importance of them having a dedicated, distraction-free area with a closed door, a computer, and a comfortable chair for the session. The use of phones for attending virtual sessions is discouraged.\n\nMy son said he received a text with a short survey about how he was feeling after I put his information into the intake forms.\n\nBut a few days before the appointment, I got an email and a text saying my appointment may be canceled due to incomplete paperwork. I logged into the portal and looked over the paperwork section. The insurance section said it was marked \u201cskipped\u201d by the intake coordinator since our insurance had already been confirmed. I assumed this was what was triggering the messages. I received no further warnings, and the appointment still existed in the portal as of the day before, so I assumed everything was all set.\n\nFort Health uses the Healthie platform for its user portal. There is no button for logging in to be found on the main Fort Health website, so to make this easier on myself I could either bookmark the Healthie site or log in via one of the emails I had received from Fort Health regarding my appointment. Healthie is available on a desktop browser and as an app.\n\nThe patient portal is essentially the same on a browser or the app. It\u2019s very minimal. I could message the therapist, view or submit paperwork, upload documents, find billing information, edit my account or payment details, do a test video session, view my and my son\u2019s upcoming appointments, and make an appointment. When I clicked on a scheduled appointment, I could reschedule it, cancel it, or join it at the allotted time. The only thing I felt was missing in the portal was the ability to view our therapist\u2019s credentials and bio.\n\nMy son and I both received multiple reminder emails and texts in the days leading up to our appointments to ensure we remembered to attend.\n\nOur initial therapy evaluation appointment, which my son and I both attended, went very well. Our therapist explained treatment expectations at the service and that sessions occur once a week for 55 minutes, with patients attending by phone in case of emergency. She went over the cancellation policy again and noted that more than 10 minutes late was considered a no-show. Subsequent appointments would always be made with the therapist at the end of each session, with the expectation that they would generally be at the same time and day every week.\n\nShe explained that Fort Health uses a shorter-term approach than some other services: A full course of treatment is only expected to last 12 to 20 weeks. In addition, caregivers are expected to attend a 30-minute session with their child\u2019s therapist every two to four weeks. She said this would likely be covered by our insurance and should take place during the daytime hours to save the afternoon and evening slots for children\u2019s appointments.\n\n[5]\n\nThe therapist then asked us about what brought us to therapy. It was clear that she\u2019d read the intake information I\u2019d submitted, which I appreciated. She was very upfront about Fort Health not having any providers who specialized in treating OCD. She even gave us the name of another online service that could help us. Though she assured us that she could help with social anxiety, she understood we may not want to continue with the service because they could not treat OCD. This is something I had never encountered at an online therapy platform before: admission of a lack of specialization and encouragement to seek help elsewhere. I can\u2019t imagine any of the big online therapy platforms doing anything but happily accepting my money.\n\nI said since our insurance was accepted and my son\u2019s biggest issue at the moment was how social anxiety was making school miserable, we would happily try a few sessions.\n\nIn addition to treating all types of anxiety, Fort Health asserts it can help with:\n\nWhile the individual therapy sessions are meant to be between just the child and therapist, my son was nervous, so our therapist assured us I could be there at the beginning to help him transition into the appointment. This was probably the least stressed my son has ever been in a live therapy session. He was comfortable talking to her, which made therapy feel less anxiety-provoking.\n\nHe said the therapist controlled the conversation well and prevented the dreaded awkwardness of long quiet pauses. She was skilled at putting him at ease and helping him be less anxious about talking to a therapist in the first place. She taught him actionable strategies to calm down when he feels those physical symptoms of anxiety start to kick in. These can help prevent him from getting to the point of feeling overwhelmed.\n\nWe scheduled two subsequent sessions at the end of the appointment.\n\nOur second regular session was canceled because the provider was ill. I received a phone call and an email at 9:30 a.m. letting me know that our provider was out sick and our appointment later that afternoon was canceled. While I would\u2019ve preferred we get a make-up session later the same week, I understand that schedules are tight and it likely isn\u2019t possible to reschedule and still fit in a full day of sessions within the next two days.\n\nBecause we\u2019ve had such a good experience with our provider so far, this cancellation didn\u2019t bother me. We still plan to meet with her at the same time next week.\n\nAlso on offer at Fort Health are child psychiatry services and caregiver coaching services. Psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse practitioners at Fort Health can prescribe psychotropic medications appropriate for children via an initial evaluation appointment and regular follow-ups. Caregiver coaching consists of two 30-minute sessions and multiple short educational videos. We did not test these services.\n\nRescheduling upcoming appointments is easy in the Fort Health portal \u2014 as long as your provider has availability within the week that works with your schedule. Otherwise you would likely just cancel your appointment for that week and see your therapist the following week as usual. Since services are charged per appointment and there are no subscriptions, you would simply not make any further appointments with Fort Health to end services. You must cancel or reschedule your appointment with at least 48 hours\u2019 notice, though. The site literally won\u2019t let you cancel or reschedule if it\u2019s less than that. In this case, you can message your provider to reschedule within the week if possible to avoid the cancellation charge.\n\nFort Health is a much smaller operation than many online therapy companies, both in terms of how many providers it employs and the number of states where it\u2019s available. Compared to huge platforms likeTalkspaceorBetterHelp/Teen Counseling(whose teen therapy services we\u2019ve also tried), Fort Health feels very much like a boutique, personalized experience.\n\nBetween the phone call with an intake coordinator and the openness of the therapist about their specialization, Fort Health felt much more like a virtual version of a local therapy office. Still, even though the company is smaller, we still didn\u2019t have to join a waiting list and found a therapist with availability within a week of signing up. When signing up for both Talkspace and BetterHelp, you feel more like just another number than a person. While Talkspace accepted our insurance and offers psychiatry/medication management services, BetterHelp doesn\u2019t accept any insurance and only provides therapy.\n\nBoth Talkspace and BetterHelp can only treat teenagers (age 13 and up), while Fort Health can treat children as young as age 4. Only a few other online therapy services treat children this young. Little Otter treats ages 0 to 14, so it is geared toward the younger crowd: My 16-year-old would be too old. Plus, it\u2019s only available in a few states. LifeStance Health can treat kids of any age and also offers family therapy, but it\u2019s not available nationwide, and therapist availability can vary widely between states.\n\nDoctor On Demandoffers therapy and psychiatry/medication management services to people of all ages and accepts insurance. I like Doctor On Demand: It\u2019s what my son uses for psychiatry, and I have used it for therapy. The providers are caring and professional, and I appreciate that it also has a pay-per-appointment model like Fort Health.Amwellis another platform similar to Doctor On Demand that offers mental and medical care appointments. Amwell can provide therapy to kids as young as age 10. Both Doctor On Demand and Amwell are available nationwide.\n\nI would definitely recommend Fort Health to anyone looking for short-term online mental health services for their child as well as coaching and support for themselves as caregivers. The company serves a wide range of ages, accepts insurance, offers personalized service, and (despite its smaller size) has plenty of provider availability. I really appreciate being able to message with the provider through the patient portal: Therapist messaging isn\u2019t something that\u2019s usually found at these smaller companies. However, I do wish I could see more detailed provider profiles there as well. This would be especially helpful if I was looking to switch providers.\n\nMy son says he has been using the strategies his therapist taught him at school and that he is willing to continue working with this therapist after the testing period. This speaks volumes. Honestly, it\u2019s a small miracle. He usually can\u2019t get me to cancel an online therapy service fast enough and has never found a therapist who has made him feel so at ease about therapy itself and who has offered such concrete, actionable strategies for managing his anxiety. I believe this service can definitely help my son get control of his anxiety and make school more bearable.\n\nThat said, if your child has a diagnosis like OCD or something else outside the company\u2019s stated wheelhouse, it may not be a good fit for you \u2014 and the service will likely advise you of this. It\u2019s also not the service for you if you need a long-term therapy solution. The company considers 12 to 20 weeks of therapy a full course of treatment.\n\nFort Health\u2019s privacy policyis easily accessible and written in plain language instead of legalese. It doesn\u2019t contain anything that alarms me. It states: \u201cWe believe that your health information should have heightened privacy protections, which is also required by federal and state laws. All collection, use, and disclosure of your health information through the Site is governed by Professionals\u2019 Health Information Privacy Policy.\u201d\n\nHere at Everyday Health, we\u2019re testing more than 65 different online therapy companies in order to find the very best ones for your needs. We\u2019re testing them all in the same way \u2014 by doing reporting to vet the company and its business practices, by interviewing and speaking with a dozen different licensed therapists, by surveying real online therapy users, and by testing each service with professional journalists and/or therapists.\n\nTo assess this service, we looked at its quality of care, ease of sign-up, prices, intake process, therapist qualifications, and the user-friendliness of its platform.

Here's how their unique vertically integrated model is transforming the seaweed farming industry.", "date": "2024-10-10", "full_content": "Company Name:Atlantic Sea Farms\n\nLocation:Biddeford, Maine\n\nYear Founded:2018\n\nWebsite:atlanticseafarms.com\n\nAtlantic Sea Farms, a regenerative seaweed farming company in Biddeford, Maine, has earned its place as the 2024CO\u2014100Top Honoree in The Disruptors category.\n\nFounded by CEO Briana Warner in 2018, Atlantic Sea Farms has helped shape an entirely new seaweed farming industry in the United States. It was the first commercial seaweed farm in the country and is now responsible for the majority of domestic seaweed farming.\n\nAs a mission-driven, woman-run company, Atlantic Sea Farms is breaking barriers, leading the new market, and reshaping the future of food production.\n\nBefore Atlantic Sea Farms, large-scale seaweed farming in North America was nearly non-existent. When the company started, only about 30,000 pounds of kelp were farmed in the entire country that year. Thanks to the innovative leadership of Warner and her team, that number has skyrocketed to 1.3 million pounds farmed by fishermen in 2024.\n\n\u201cWe have grown this industry by working with fishermen who are seeing increased volatility in their heritage livelihoods as a result of rapidly warming waters,\u201d said Warner. \u201cBy focusing on aggregating small, family farms to create a scaled industry, we have ensured that the growth of this entirely new industry puts small farmers and the environment first.\u201d\n\nAtlantic Sea Farms is fully vertically integrated, meaning the company produces kelp seeds in-house and distributes them to fishermen free of charge. These partner farmers in the Gulf of Maine grow the kelp in open ocean environments, and Atlantic Sea Farms guarantees that it will buy back all harvested seaweed.\n\n\u201cWe are working with fishermen to diversify their incomes in the face of climate change as their fisheries become increasingly volatile and vulnerable,\u201d explained Warner.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy road to scale Atlantic Sea Farms\u2019 nursery, manufacturing, farming, and market demand all at the same time.\n\n\u201cVertical integration is not for the faint of heart,\u201d said Warner. \u201cBeing the first mover in each of these segments has been an incredible amount of trial and error, but we have learned so much through the process.\u201d\n\nBeing the first mover in each of these segments has been an incredible amount of trial and error, but we have learned so much through the process.\n\nBriana Warner, Founder and CEO, Atlantic Sea Farms\n\nAtlantic Sea Farms\u2019 success goes beyond simple innovation \u2014 it is rooted in a commitment to environmental and economic sustainability. Ocean kelp farming offers an environmentally restorative method of food production, requiring no arable land, freshwater, or pesticides.\n\n\u201cWe are removing carbon and nitrogen from the water column and making the ocean more healthy than before the kelp was farmed,\u201d Warner explained.\n\nThe company\u2019s mission doesn\u2019t stop at improving the environment: Atlantic Sea Farms is actively disrupting a seafood industry dominated by male leadership. Warner said less than 1% of all C-suite positions in the seafood industry are held by women, but Atlantic Sea Farms is challenging that status quo.\n\n\u201cSince we are creating the farmed seaweed industry in the U.S., there isn't a glass ceiling,\u201d she said. \u201cWe get to build an entirely new industry without limits for women \u2014 and that is exciting.\u201d\n\nWarner said she hopes that women starting in aquaculture in the U.S. can see themselves in some of the female leaders who are taking charge of innovative aquaculture businesses across the country, thereby changing the way people think about the industry.\n\n\u201cBy getting the seafood sector to more of a gender balance, we can challenge the conventional wisdom that has gotten us to a breaking point on the ocean,\u201d she added. \u201cLet\u2019s restore ocean abundance by bringing new thinking to the table.\u201d\n\nAtlantic Sea Farms\u2019 achievements are inextricably linked to its use of cutting-edge technology. The company\u2019s seed production and manufacturing processes are the only ones of their kind in the Western Hemisphere. This pioneering approach to seaweed farming has not only allowed the industry to scale but has also fostered an entirely new market for nutrient-dense, climate-positive food products in the U.S.\n\n\u201cBefore ASF, people didn't know how to farm seaweed at scale in the U.S.,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were able to learn from places like Korea about how to farm seaweed in U.S. waters. Then we adapted those learnings to the back of lobster boats to catalyze a new industry that could help fishers along our coast diversify in the face of dramatic climate change.\u201d\n\nThanks to Atlantic Sea Farms, lobster boats have become the \u201ckelp tractors of the sea\u201d in Maine. The company has also developed ways to grow seeds in its state-of-the-art seaweed nursery.\n\n\u201c[This] has allowed us to get strong yields and consistent product, in addition to creating first of its kind seaweed processing machinery in our manufacturing facility,\u201d Warner explained.\n\nWarner and her team continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in food production, all while staying committed to their mission of supporting fishing communities, adapting to climate change, promoting inclusivity, and improving the planet.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to be building an entirely new industry and proving that good food can do good by leading the charge,\u201d said Warner.\n\nCO\u2014 aims to bring you inspiration from leading respected experts.

Jiminy's 2022. Carlson tells the story of Lauren, a millennial Jiminy's customer who refers to her dog Mordecai as \"her son.\"", "date": "2022-11-07", "full_content": "ByDavid Riemer,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nAnne Carlson, founder and CEO ofJiminy\u2019s, was two years into building her new, sustainable pet food company, before she was able to tell the story of why she created it. It turns out that the story was too emotional for Carlson to share in public. It was a classic \u201cpurpose story\u201d that began with an upsetting conversation Carlson had with her adult daughter about the future of our planet. The conversation was the \u201cinciting incident\u201d in her story that led the former Del Monte executive to tackle climate change by identifying new sources of protein for pet food\u2014starting with crickets. Since creating the company, Carlson and her team have raised $6 million in seed money, secured distribution in 1,100 Petco stores, built a direct-to-consumers business and generated millions in annual revenue. Now, as Carlson looks to raise a Series A to help dramatically scale the business, she has a new storytelling challenge.\n\nJiminy's CEO, Anne Carlson with her dogs Tuco (below) and Timber (above).\n\nBut this startup story starts with Carlson\u2019s origin story.\n\nWhile at Del Monte, Carlson helped aggregate and sell its pet food assets and rebrand them as Big Heart Pet Brands. In 2016, the J.M. Smucker Company bought the new pet brand, and Carlson moved on to think about her next thing. Around this time, Carlson had a conversation that most parents eventually have with their adult children about whether they hope to have kids one day. Carlson\u2019s daughter answered, \u201cno.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t want to bring them into a world that was devolving due to climate change. Carlson was heartbroken. She wished her daughter would experience the same joy she had raising a family. And she might have felt a bit guilty as well about not doing enough to change the narrative. Looking back, Carlson says, \u201cI realized that I couldn\u2019t just do a normal job after that\u2014building a better future for her was everything.\u201d\n\nBecause of Carlson\u2019s experience in the pet food business, she knew thatan estimated 25%-35%of domestic meat production was used to feed dogs and cats. Dogs alone consume 32 billion pounds of protein annually. The environmental impact of feeding pets in the U.S. is huge, because of the massive amount of land, water and feed required to raise cows and chickens. In researching alternatives, Carlson discovered that insects, especially crickets, are a tremendous source of protein that require a fraction of the resources required to produce traditional meat products. Cricket production, by example, generates 99% lessgreenhouse gasthan chicken production. Jiminy\u2019s was created to address this macro problem. In Carlson\u2019s early pitches, she focused on this big picture story.\n\nBut this is where things get more complicated and the real storytelling challenge emerges. The story that inspired Carlson to start the company is a memorable way to introduce Jiminy\u2019s, but to raise a series A, she must also convince investors that there\u2019s a massive market of pet owners willing to feed their dogs insect-based food. This is a common challenge for the founder who has a great origin story for their business. They\u2019ve told ustheirstory, but they\u2019ve yet to introduce the true protagonist in their product story. There has to be acustomerwith a set of needs that only Jiminy\u2019s can solve.\n\nThe good news for Carlson is that millennial and Gen Z pet owners are extraordinarily conscious of \u2014 and troubled by \u2014 the causes of climate change; and they\u2019re knowledgeable about emerging solutions. They also make-up nearly half the dog ownership in the U.S. Now Carlson has the protagonist for her new story.\n\nJiminy's Chewy Cricket Treat\n\nCarlson tells the story of Lauren, a millennial Jiminy\u2019s customer who refers to her dog Mordecai as \u201cher son.\u201d Lauren, like Carlson\u2019s daughter, is extremely worried about climate change so much so that she uses the \u201cgreener\u201d peer-to-peer videoconferencing solutionCrewdleinstead of Zoom for her work and non-profit board meetings. That\u2019s the big picture stuff. But when it comes to Mordecai, an adorable deaf rescue pup, Lauren\u2019s concerned about her dog\u2019s gut health. Mordecai isn\u2019t a lot of fun to be around, when suffering from stomach ailments. Lauren also wants meal options she can provide her pet throughout the day. Custom meal services are expensive and have way too much packaging. She\u2019d be delighted to try a more sustainable pet food, if it was healthy for the dog and came in different formats. Lauren\u2019s heard that insects are an emerging source of protein and she\u2019s willing to try something new.\n\nJiminy's expanding line-up of insect-based pet food.\n\nJiminy\u2019s answers the call. Jiminy\u2019s is asustainable pet foodusing insect protein. Once a customer like Lauren switches from a traditional meat-based pet food to Jiminy\u2019s, for example, it could save 200,000 to 2,000,000 gallons of water every year depending on the size of the dog and whether it had been eating chicken or beef based food (Jiminy\u2019s offers aneco-calculatorto figure this out). The food is nutritious, prebiotic and hypoallergenic. It includes fiber, iron, vitamin B2 and 12. And finally, Jiminy\u2019s offers a host of products from wet food to treats that can feed a dog throughout the day.\n\nFor her roadshow, Carlson will lead with her emotional origin story and quickly pivot to Lauren\u2019s story. Prospective investors will learn why Carlson is so passionate about creating a new pet brand to fight climate change, and why customers like Lauren are buying it. Lauren says, \u201csince switching (brands), Mordecai is a whole new dog. He's healthier, his fur is softer, his breath is better, and we can now breathe around him!\u201d And Lauren also feels like she\u2019s doing her part for the planet. It\u2019s a powerful one-two punch that Carlson hopes will help her raise an $8 million series A to expand her business and promote a healthier future one dog at a time.", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Jiminy's", "title": "Don't Like Eating Insects?

But, being a dog \u2014 with a voracious appetite and no discernible appreciation for narrative tension \u2014 he devoured them immediately. He didn\u2019t know, or care, that they were chock-full of dried crickets and ground-up grubs.\n\nAnd so what I had envisioned as a climactic taste test was over in seconds, with what was, in retrospect, an utterly predictable result: my dog would happily eat insects.\n\nFor years, some enterprising food entrepreneurs have been trying to convince people to do the same.As the global demand for protein grows, insects, they say, provide a more sustainable, ethical alternative to traditional meat. But the idea has been a tough sell. Although insects are a dietary staple in some cultures, for many people, they trigger a visceral disgust response.\n\nBut dogs? If they have a disgust reflex, I haven\u2019t seen it. Insect entrepreneurs looking for open-minded eaters could hardly do better than good old Canis lupus familiaris.\n\n\u201cThe dogs are not going to overthink it,\u201d said Anne Carlson, the chief executive of Jiminy\u2019s, which makes insect-based pet food and treats.\n\nHers is one of many pet food companies trying to remake meat. Earlier this year,the British company Meatlysold a limited run of dog treats made with lab-grown chicken. BioCraft Pet Nutrition, in Austria, is working to turn stem cells from mice into food for cats and dogs. And Bond Pet Foods, in the United States, is using yeast to produce animal protein through the process of fermentation.\n\nThere\u2019s still substantial skepticism about the future of insect protein and lab-grown meat in the human food supply \u2014 and about whether such ingredients can really wean us off our rib-eyes and fried chicken. Some entrepreneurs see pet food as a natural proving ground.\n\nIf a company can \u201ccrack the code for pet food, the path to commercialization could be relatively easier,\u201d said Rich Kelleman, the chief executive of Bond Pet Foods. Pet food companies don\u2019t need to replicate the experience of biting into a perfectly crisped drumstick. \u201cFor dogs and cats, it has to taste good,\u201d Mr. Kelleman said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to taste like chicken, exactly.\u201d\n\nIndustrial animal agriculture takes a profound toll on the environment, requiring lots of land and water, and producing significant pollution, including greenhouse gases.\n\nThe pet food industry, which often uses agricultural byproducts, has a smaller environmental footprint than the human food sector. \u201cBut it is material, and we shouldn\u2019t ignore it,\u201d said Peter Alexander, an expert on global food systems at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nIna 2020 study, Dr. Alexander and his colleagues found that dry dog and cat food accounted for between 1 and 3 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with agriculture. (Wet food tends to contain more prime meat and have a higher impact.)\n\n\u201cFor individuals who maybe have a fairly low-emission diet and don\u2019t do much traveling, but they have a large dog \u2014 actually, the dog could have a really substantial footprint,\u201d Dr. Alexander said.\n\nInsects and lab-made animal protein have the potential to be far less damaging to the environment. And because pets tend to eat the same thing every day, changing their food \u201ccan have real impact,\u201d Ms. Carlson said. \u201cIt\u2019s like flipping a switch. One day it\u2019s unsustainable, the next, it\u2019s sustainable.\u201d\n\nReducing our reliance on industrial animal agriculture could also prevent immense animal suffering. \u201cIn the pet industry, it\u2019s all about loving animals,\u201d said Owen Ensor, the chief executive of Meatly. \u201cAnd I think a lot of people are increasingly uncomfortable with needing to harm and kill a lot of other animals to feed those animals.\u201d\n\nVegan pet food also addresses these problems but has to be very carefully formulated \u2014 and it won\u2019t appeal to all owners, alt-meat entrepreneurs say. \u201cPeople want to feed their pets meat,\u201d said Mr. Ensor, who is vegan but has two cats who are not.\n\nIn addition to Watson, I also have two cats. At first, figuring out how to feed them all was like trying to solve an impossible riddle.\n\nWatson, an intensely food-motivated dog with a heart condition, needs a weight-control kibble and must be kept away from the cat food, which he finds tantalizingly delicious. Juniper, my chronically underweight cat, should ideally have free access to her food \u2014 and is also a picky eater who reliably consumes only chicken. Then there\u2019s Goose, a cat who will eat until he makes himself sick and happens to have a food sensitivity to, yes, chicken.\n\nFinding the right meal plan for this menagerie took months of trial and error. So, as much as the sustainability and animal welfare arguments appeal to me, I\u2019m reluctant to start switching things up.\n\nI\u2019m not alone, apparently.\u201cWhat we\u2019re learning is that people don\u2019t really react or buy based on sustainability,\u201d Ms. Carlson said.\n\nShannon Falconer, the chief executive of BioCraft Pet Nutrition, agreed. \u201cThe main driver of any and all pet parent is the health of their animal,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will supersede anything else.\u201d In fact, another trend in the pet food market \u2014 the rise of high-end, human-grade products loaded with prime meat \u2014 runs directly counter to the quest for greater sustainability.\n\nSome companies are leaning hard into health claims. Insects, they say, are perfect for pets like Goose, who are sensitive or allergic to common proteins. It\u2019s a compelling argument, and if I ever need to find a new food for Goose, I\u2019d consider an insect-based one.\n\nBut I\u2019m not yet convinced by claims that insect protein is a \u201csuperfood\u201d \u2014 one that some companies suggest could improve everything from gut health and coat quality to cognition and immune function.\n\nResearch suggests that insects are indeed a \u201chigh-quality protein source,\u201d with good digestibility and palatability, said Kelly Swanson, a comparative nutritionist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. But data on specific functional benefits is limited, especially in cats and dogs. And companies will need to demonstrate that their products include enough of the ingredient to bring about whatever benefits they\u2019re promising, Dr. Swanson said.\n\nCreating nutritionally balanced products will require a deep understanding of these new proteins. Ina study published earlier this year, Belgian researchers found that many insect-based pet foods carried inaccurate nutritional labels, and that some of those products were deficient in one or more critical nutrients. \u201cThere are still a lot of gaps in the knowledge and research,\u201d said Camila Baptista da Silva, a doctoral student at Ghent University and an author of the study.\n\nFor their part, cultivated-meat companies note that their products are made without antibiotics or hormones, in controlled environments free of the pathogens that lurk in barns and slaughterhouses. But lab-grown meatisn\u2019t risk-free; it could contain novel allergens, or be contaminated by pathogens during the production process.\n\nUltimately, whether alternative proteins pay environmental dividends will depend on many factors, including how they are made \u2014 some production methods can be resource intensive \u2014 how widely they are adopted and what pet food products they displace.\n\nAs Dr. Alexander put it, \u201cIt all comes down to, \u2018What are you swapping from? What are you swapping to?\u2019\u201d Transitioning from pet food containing premium beef, which has an especially high environmental impact, to products with lab-grown meat would probably yield environmental benefits, he said. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m doubtful that switching from animal byproducts or plant-based ingredients to lab-grown meat will be beneficial,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd in order to have a real impact, alt-protein companies will need to produce these ingredients at higher quantities and lower prices. Meatly, which is currently raising money for an industrial-scale production facility, launched with a limited supply of dog treats made with just four percent cultivated chicken.\n\nYora Pet Foods sells large bags of its insect-based dog kibble for $4.50 to $5 a pound, more than one-and-a-half times what I pay for Watson\u2019s current food. At the moment, the grubs Yora uses cost almost as much to produce as free-range chicken, said James Milbourne, a managing director at the company. \u201cIf you walk into the shop and you\u2019ve got a bag of lovely free-range chicken and a bag of insects, and they\u2019re the same price,\u201d he said, \u201cit just makes it more difficult to get that person to take a punt on it.\u201d\n\nBut if companies can scale up and bring prices down, I do think customers will follow. Ina 2022 study, nearly half of dog and cat owners surveyed, including some who had no interest in eating lab-grown meat themselves, said they\u2019d be willing to feed cultivated meat to their pets.\n\nI\u2019d consider it, too, although there aren\u2019t currently such products available for purchase. And while I didn\u2019t want to change any of my pets\u2019 primary foods, I was happy to offer up some insect-based treats.\n\nGoose gobbled them down almost as quickly as Watson did. But fickle Juniper wouldn\u2019t touch the cricket treats, and she was hot and cold on the fly variety. Some days she seemed happy to scarf them down; other days she seemed almost offended by the offering. I could find no logic in her ever-shifting preferences. But there\u2019s no accounting for taste, I guess \u2014 or often, it seems, for cats.\n\nEmily Anthes is a science reporter, writing primarily about animal health and science.
