The watch weighs 49 grams (about 1.7 ounces). It's 1.6 inches in diameter and 0.5 inches thick.", "date": "2025-05-13", "full_content": "Our Buyers Guide Top Picks\n\nThe UnaliWear Kanega Watch is a more discreet alternative to traditional medical alert devices. The watch weighs 49 grams (about 1.7 ounces). It\u2019s 1.6 inches in diameter and 0.5 inches thick. It comes with a patented quick-swap battery, so you never have to take it off to charge.\n\nThe UnaliWear Kanega Watch is a stand-alone personal emergency response device, so you don\u2019t need a landline or cellphone to make it work. Instead, it relies on Verizon\u2019s nationwide cellular network. The watch connects to your home Wi-Fi but automatically switches to Verizon\u2019s network when you leave your home.\n\nYou can call for help in multiple ways. If you press and hold the button on the right side of the watch (called the crown button) for a couple of seconds, you\u2019ll be connected to the monitoring center. These trained professionals have your contact information and the names of your caregivers and know exactly whom to notify and where to dispatch help.\n\nYou can also use voice commands through the watch\u2019s built-in microphone. Finally, if you fall, the watch automatically detects the unusual movement and notifies the monitors.\n\nUnaliWear offers two different pricing structures for the Kanega Watch. You can make an upfront payment for the whole year, or you can pay monthly from the start. No matter how you pay, you have a one-time setup fee.\n\nAs of publishing, if you choose to pay monthly from the start, your one-time setup fee is $299. Then, you\u2019ll pay $69.95 a month for monitoring services.\n\nThere\u2019s no contract with either payment structure, so you can cancel the service anytime. But note that the watch and the accessories aren\u2019t yours to keep. You have to return everything in good condition if you cancel the monitoring service.\n\nDesigned with an older user in mind, the UnaliWear Kanega Watch has many features to help improve independence, including:\n\nCompare UnaliWear with othermedical alert companies.\n\nThe company name comes from the Cherokee words \u201cUnalii,\u201d which means friend, and \u201cKanega,\u201d which means speak. When you put them together, you have a friend who speaks to you.\n\nUnaliWear covers defects in materials and workmanship for as long as you have it, as long as you are current on your service payments. If any issues come up, UnaliWear will replace the watch for free.\n\nThe company also covers replacement and shipping at no cost the first time you break the watch. Be aware that UnaliWear does not cover replacement of a watch in all circumstances.\n\nAfter 30 days, you can cancel the service at any time as long as you return all equipment. You\u2019ll get a refund (minus a $75 restocking fee) if all equipment is returned in good condition. Annual plans will be issued a prorated refund based on the nondiscounted monthly rate of $69.95.\n\nTo cancel your monitoring service through UnaliWear, you need to call the company\u2019s customer support team. As a part of the cancellation, you must send the equipment back in good condition. A lost or damaged watch results in a fee of up to $650.\n\nThe company\u2019s headquarters is in Austin, Texas.\n\nUnaliWear helps vulnerable people enjoy more independence through its medical alert technology. The stylish Kanega Watch includes 24/7 U.S.-based monitoring, fall detection, medication reminders and a 30-day money-back guarantee. Since the watch uses Wi-Fi and LTE technologies, wearers don\u2019t need a landline to access help. In addition, UnaliWear doesn\u2019t require a long-term contract.\n\nShop with confidence\n\nCompare with top companies\n\nFilter by Rating\n\nPopular Mentions\n\nA link has directed you to this review. Its location on this page may change next time you visit.\n\nReviewed Sept. 17, 2024\n\nThe Kanega Watch has been a lifesaver for my grandma (and mom!). My grandma lives independently and is able to continue to do so because the Kanega provides round the clock coverage in the case of an emergency. And even better, my mom can rest easy, knowing she's safe. We chose the Kanega because the 24/7 monitoring service already knows who she is when an alert comes from the watch. After doing so much research online, we found that the Kanega's coverage and service was far superior to others on the market. Totally worth the price!\n\nReviewed March 12, 2024\n\nI bought this watch for my mother in December 2023. Two months later the screen went blank and it was not usable. I made several calls and wrote emails to the company's customer service department. The calls repeatedly were answered by the \"overflow\" service department, which was not qualified to actually troubleshoot problems. After a week of no response on how to fix the watch, I returned it. If you want a watch that detects falls and will notify emergency services, I would suggest an Apple Watch. The Apple Watch does everything the Kanega does and more, and it costs less.\n\nThanks for subscribing.\n\nYou have successfully subscribed to our newsletter! Enjoy reading our tips and recommendations.\n\nReviewed Feb. 17, 2024\n\nThe watch band was too large even though the wrist measured within the range for small. And the watch was heavy, too heavy for a small person to sleep when wearing. This may work better for larger folks, but if you're small, I would not recommend it. The $75 return fee is very steep and you need to go through customer service, which tries and tries to change your mind, to return it.\n\nReviewed Nov. 15, 2023\n\nWe got the Kanega Watch for my father several years ago. He loves it and he wears it all the time, which is the total point. The fall detection has worked as advertised, and he enjoys asking his watch for the time and date. Tremendous peace of mind for him and our whole family. I highly recommend!\n\nReviewed Oct. 22, 2023\n\nI purchased the watch on 9/6/2023, I received it around 9/11/2023. I lost a battery out of it on 10/2/2023, I had no idea how I lost it. Now on 10/22/2023 the watch band has broken where it attaches with the battery to watch. Very unhappy with the construction as I bought a battery for about $36 plus shipping about 3 weeks after purchase and now about 6 weeks later it is broken. I am emailing the company today to see what they will do about this situation. I paid $918.40. I would expect a better quality.\n\nReviewed Sept. 16, 2023\n\nThe service is great. There is very little set up and it is very easy to do. Once we received the watch there were 3 very short videos to watch and then you call the center and they do a test call with you. My Aunt loves the device because it isn't a pendant that gets in the way, flops around or looks out of place when she dresses up and goes out. She also likes the fact that she never has to take it off and can wear it in the shower.\n\nOur only complaint is that after only 3 months the first watch band broke where the battery goes in. We didn't realize it cracked and one battery was lost and then the band broke all together. I believe that a more rubberized battery chamber would be a better housing for the battery. The other disappointment was we had to pay $50 for shipping for a new watch. This seems a bit steep. We haven't found anything better at this time but the shipping cost did cause the luster of this product to dull somewhat.\n\nCheck out our buyers guide top picks\n\nOur Buyers Guide Top Picks:", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Unaliwear", "title": "UnaliWear Kanega Watch Review", "url": "https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/unaliwear-kanega-watch", "source": "PC Magazine", "body": "I've been working with computers for ages, starting with a multi-year stint in purchasing for a major IBM reseller in New York City before eventually landing at PCMag (back when it was still in ...", "date": "2022-03-31", "full_content": "Smartwatchesaren't just for sending texts and monitoring your fitness activities. Designed to look like a regular watch, the UnaliWear Kanega Watch (starting at $149.99 upfront, then $59.95 per month) is amedical alert devicethat connects you to an emergency response center with the touch of a button or a simple voice command. It calls for help when you fall down, and also tells you when to take your medicine. If you don't need fall detection, however, we prefer theMedical Guardian MGMovethanks to its superior caregiver tools and lower subscription pricing.\n\nAvailable with a black, champagne gold, or rose gold bezel, the Kanega Watch face measures 1.6 inches in diameter and is 0.5 inches thick. The screen is a bit larger than that of the Medical Guardian MGMove (1.25 inches in diameter), and the Kanega\u2019s black-and-gold mesh wrist band makes the watch look and feel bulkier. It has anIP67 waterproof ratingand you get several straps in the box so you can pick the one that best fits your wrist.\n\nAnother reason for the additional heft are the two rechargeable battery packs (one on each side of the watch) that you can remove and charge via the three-port battery charger that comes in the box. You get a total of four batteries in the package, which means you can keep two of them charged at all times. The batteries are easy to swap out, and the process doesn't even require you to remove the watch. UnaliWear recommends changing the batteries daily (they last up to 36 hours) and provides free replacements when they reach the end of their charging life (approximately 18 months with regular use).\n\nThe Kanega Watch has GPS, cellular (Verizon), and Wi-Fi radios that can help pinpoint your exact location in the event of an emergency. Its screen uses white text on a black background, a departure from the full-color touch screens you get with theLifeStation Sidekick Smartand the Medical Guardian MGMove watches. According to UnaliWear, the high-contrast monochrome display is easier to read if you suffer from glaucoma or macular degeneration.\n\nThe right side of the watch houses a speaker and a microphone for two-way hands-free communication and for issuing voice commands. To communicate with the watch using voice commands, begin with the phrase \u201cFred Astaire,\u201d which is the watch\u2019s name. Once you activate the voice command option, you can ask questions such as, \u201cFred Astaire, what time is it?\u201d and \u201cFred Astaire, what day is it?\u201d to hear an audible response. If you say, \u201cFred Astaire, call the operator,\u201d or, \u201cFred Astaire, get help,\u201d the watch places a call to the 24/7 emergency response center.\n\nAlso on the right side is a crown button that you use to initiate a call to a representative and to navigate through each screen. Press the button for five seconds to connect to an agent, or press and release it quickly to display the current time, day, date, and battery level. Press it a second time to view just the day of the week and date, and then quickly press it twice to toggle to a screen that displays the time, date, battery level, and Wi-Fi signal strength. Continue to single press the crown button to toggle through the settings screens where you select a watch face (you get 12- or 24-hour format and digital or analog options), adjust the speaker volume and screen brightness, update phone settings, enable airplane mode, view a how-to tutorial, and obtain a security code to use with the web portal.\n\nOne important note: The Kanega Watch requires a subscription. You can choose between an annual or quarterly plan, but both require you to pay a one-time setup fee ($149.99 and $249.99 respectively). You pay upfront for each plan\u2014either $719.40 per year (the equivalent of $59.95 per month) or $209.85 per quarter (the equivalent of $69.95 per month).\n\nSign up for the Lab Report newsletter to receive PCMag's latest product reviews, buying advice, and insights.\n\nBy clicking Sign Me Up, you confirm you are 16+ and agree to ourTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nYour subscription has been confirmed. Keep an eye on your inbox!\n\nFor comparison, LifeStation's monthly plan for its Sidekick Smart watch costs $43.95 per month. The Medical Guardian MGMove watch has an upfront cost of $199.99 and requires a $39.95-per-month subscription ($36.62 per month if you pay annually), but neither it nor the Sidekick Smart offer fall detection.\n\nThe Kanega watch offers generic medicine reminders, but lacks many of the features that you get with the MGMove including a built-in pedometer, as well as a companion app that allows you to send messages to trusted contacts and set reminders for appointments and medications. The My Guardian app for the MGMove also lets people in your support circle monitor your emergency alert events and pinpoint your exact location on a map.\n\nUnaliWear offers a web portal for the Kanega Watch, but all you can do here is enter up to five daily medicine reminders and configure Wi-Fi settings.\n\nTo prepare the Kanega Watch for first use, you need to charge the batteries for approximately two hours. After you install the batteries in the watch, press the crown button to launch a voice-activated tutorial. The voice prompts tell you how to get the time by asking for it, how to use the help button, and how to test the watch. You also receive an email to schedule an onboarding call with a UnaliWear representative to go over things like how the watch and voice activation works, how emergency dispatch and fall detection features function, where the microphone is, and how to install batteries.\n\nWe test response time by clocking how long it takes for a device to connect us with a live response agent after we press the call button. The Kanega Watch took an average of 46 seconds to reach a representative in our tests. That\u2019s a bit slower than the Medical Guardian MGMove (26 seconds) and the LifeStation Sidekick Smart (28 seconds), but that response time is still under a minute, which is good.\n\nThe GPS radio was always accurate in testing, and the emergency response agents we spoke with were friendly and professional. Two-way audio sounded clear and adequately loud, too.\n\nThe Kanega Watch is an inconspicuous medical alert device that can connect you to an emergency response agent if you need help, no matter where you are. Fall detection  and voice control are its main benefits, but you can set generic medicine reminders via a web portal, too. That said, you don't get the mobile app and caregiver tools we expect from medical alert devices, and the required subscription is quite pricey. Our Editors\u2019 Choice winner, the Medical Guardian MGMove, is more affordable and offers a better set of features, though it doesn't detect falls.\n\nBest Watch for Fall Detection\n\nUnaliWear\u2019s Kanega Watch detects when you fall and supports voice control, but lacks the caregiver options we expect from medical alert devices.\n\nI\u2019ve been working with computers for ages, starting with a multi-year stint in purchasing for a major IBM reseller in New York City before eventually landing at PCMag (back when it was still in print asPC Magazine).

As digital medicine continues to transform patient care, BrainCheck occupies a unique position to meet the needs of the dementia market.\n\nThrough a combination of assessments, screeners, workflows and clinical decision support algorithms, BrainCheck Care enables physicians to provide a detailed, personalized care plan to the patient and caregiver at the point of care.\n\n\"BrainCheck's rich and robust dataset on cognitive health, paired with other health and biometric data, enable us to personalize dementia care at scale,\" saidDr.Yael Katz, co-founder and CEO of BrainCheck. \"For the first time, clinicians and caregivers can observe whether interventions are working by tracing cognitive change to a patient's medications, chronic diseases, or lifestyle, and iterate on these interventions to optimize outcomes.\"\n\nChicago-based Tensility Venture Partners focuses its investments on enterprise AI companies. \"We saw a great opportunity with BrainCheck,\" saidArmando Pauker, managing director and co-founder at Tensility Venture Partners. \"They're sitting on a treasure trove of difficult-to-obtain data and are addressing a large market opportunity. They bring the power and benefits of AI into clinical care to make cognitive testing easily available to all.\"\n\n\"The research is clear and it has now been clinically proven that patients can delay the onset of dementia,\" saidCharlie Plauche, partner at S3 Ventures. \"By helping physicians detect this debilitating disease early, BrainCheck's platform technology will improve the lives of millions in the coming years.\"\n\nHeadquartered at the Texas Medical Center Innovation Institute, TMCx, BrainCheck has recently opened a second office inAustin, Texas. The funding will be used to expand the company's R&D and enhance its offering that is truly moving the needle in the dementia space. The company is also investing in sales and marketing talent to accelerate deployment in clinical practice.\n\nAbout BrainCheckBrainCheck provides rapid, mobile cognitive assessment and decision support technology to physicians, empowering them to deliver high-quality, personalized cognitive health care to patients everywhere and get reimbursed.

It also resulted in more individuals receiving important screening tests and services, including blood pressure screening (42.8% versus 28.3%), weight assessment (42.8% versus 27.7%), and depression screening (32.8% versus 16.8%).\n\n\u201cOur findings indicate that a multifaceted and relatively low-resource behavioral economic intervention may improve postpartum health and well-being,\u201d said Clapp.\"As a primary care physician, I have frequently observed how care is improved for individual patients by a careful transition between obstetrics and primary care,\" saysAlaka Ray, MD, a Mass General primary care physician and an author of the study. \"It is wonderful that this study has now demonstrated the importance of that connection in the form of significant benefits for postpartum patients with high-risk conditions.\"\"I would also note that this study population is comprised of patients who already had an established primary care physician. We all know, however, that many others cannot find a primary care physician,\" says Ray. \"It is my hope that this study will add further urgency to the call to address our worsening primary care shortage so that evidence-based interventions like this can be broadly implemented for all of our patients.\"\n\nAuthorship:Mark A.

As the CEO and president of Atlantic Sea Farms, the 38-year-old Warner is using seaweed to quietly revolutionize Maine's struggling fishing industr", "date": "2022-07-25", "full_content": "FALMOUTH, Maine \u2014 It\u2019s harvest time on Casco Bay.\n\nBriana Warner is dressed for this late spring morning in padded rubber overalls, raincoat, rubber boots and neon yellow gloves that come up above her elbows. Just off the coast of Falmouth, she hangs off the side of a Zodiac boat and uses a gaff (hook) to hoist from the water a neon green buoy attached to a thick white rope. Warner struggles and finally gets her hands around the rope. The line drips with long, shimmering, translucent ribbons of green sugar kelp.\n\nSeaweed: An unusual snack for cows, a powerful fix for the climate\n\nWarner\u2019s face lights up as she inspects the seaweed. \u201cThey\u2019re ready for harvest,\u201d she declares.\n\nAs the CEO and president ofAtlantic Sea Farms, the 38-year-old Warner is using seaweed to quietly revolutionize Maine\u2019s struggling fishing industry.\n\nUp and down the Maine coast, thousands of lines like this have been planted by fishermen growing seaweed in partnership with her company. In the fall, the fishermen plant tiny kelp seeds on the 1,000-foot-long ropes, and by late spring, attached to each one is close to 6,000 pounds of fresh sugar kelp. The seaweed is harvested, flash frozen and used to make kelp cubes for smoothies, as well as seaweed salad, seaweed kraut and more.\n\nSeaweed is Maine\u2019s new cash crop.\n\nFor generations, coastal Maine has been supported by a different underwater resource: the lobster. Lobstering is woven into virtually every aspect of life in coastal communities; tax revenue, jobs and the state\u2019s identity depend on it. But as climate change causes Maine\u2019s coastal waters to warm, underwater life, and the economy built around it, has shifted dramatically.\n\nTheGulf of Maine is warming faster than 96 percent of the world\u2019s oceans\u2014 increasing at a rate of 0.09 degrees Fahrenheit per year. These warming temperatures have forced the lobster population to migrate north, seeking colder waters, and the impact on Maine fishermen has been profound.\n\nSeaweed is easy to grow, sustainable and nutritious. But it\u2019ll never be kale.\n\nKeith Miller, 67, a second-generation lobsterman, has been lobstering for more than 50 years, fishing in Wheeler\u2019s Bay between Spruce Head and Tenants Harbor. When he saw the dramatic impact of climate change on his industry, he knew he had to plan for the six months of the year \u2014 between fall and spring \u2014 when he couldn\u2019t fish for lobster. He heard about a program in Rockland, Maine, at theIsland Institute, which helps coastal communities thrive, educating lobstermen about aquaculture.\n\n\u201cI could choose between oyster farming, mussel farming or kelp,\u201d Miller says in his thick Maine accent. \u201cWater \u2019round here is too shallow for mussels, and oysters are a year-round job. I wanted to keep lobstering half the year, so I chose seaweed.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Warner was the Island Institute\u2019s first economic development officer. A former Foreign Service diplomat, she says she\u2019s always been interested in \u201cfinding solutions rather than being part of the problem.\u201d After serving in Libya, Guinea and several other countries, she moved to Maine with her husband, who grew up in the state, and started a family. Her goal was to apply her diplomatic skills to making a difference in the state\u2019s coastal and food communities.\n\n\u201cThe question we asked was this: In communities where lobster is everything, how do we prepare for the future along the Maine coast and diversify to face climate change?\u201d Warner says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re self-employed and your entire community is dependent on one industry, and you\u2019re totally at the whim of Mother Nature, overdependence on one monoculture is very scary.\u201d\n\nMiller is one of several dozen lobstermen accepted into the aquaculture program. He describes the past five years he\u2019s spent farming seaweed in the \u201coffseason\u201d as \u201clife changing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy first year kelping, I brought in 2,200 pounds,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this year, my harvest was 170,000 pounds. I keep telling folks, \u2018My ship is coming in!\u2019\u201d\n\nRoasted seaweed is the powerhouse ingredient in this pantry pasta\n\nIn summer 2018, Warner was offered the position of CEO at Atlantic Sea Farms. When she started, two kelp farms were yielding around 30,000 pounds total. The company now works with 27 partner farmers, and the 2022 harvest brought in just under 1 million pounds of seaweed. The company\u2019s products are now sold in more than 2,000 stores across the country, as well as in restaurants and college cafeterias. In 2021, the company was responsible for 85 percent of the line-produced seaweed in the country.\n\nAnother farmer the company works with is Justin Papkee, 31, who fishes near Long Island in Casco Bay. \u201cThis country is way behind others in understanding how good kelp is for you and the environment,\u201d Papkee says. \u201cBriana is doing a great job figuring out ways to market it.\u201d\n\nPapkee, who still lobsters year-round and farms kelp a few days a week during the harvest season, says he\u2019s able to maintain his crew of three year-round and bring in extra income. Although he\u2019s hesitant to talk about money, he says this year, after four seasons of kelp farming, he is \u201cin the black.\u201d\n\nWarner calls seaweed \u201ca shock absorber against the volatility of the lobster industry.\u201d When she talks about seaweed and the industry, her speech gains momentum and her passion is on display. \u201cThe best thing about kelp is that it is the most climate-friendly food you can eat!\u201d Seaweed, she explains, is farmed without land, pesticides or fresh water.\n\nThe environmental benefits of growing seaweed go even further. \u201cThere\u2019s so much carbon in the air, and when carbon hits the ocean surface, the ocean absorbs it and changes the pH and degrades shellfish,\u201d Warner says. \u201cSeaweed absorbs the carbon and nitrogen in the water. When you harvest seaweed, you are removing carbon with it and leaving behind a healthier body of water.\u201d\n\nWarner is quick to point out that growing seaweed is not a climate change solution. \u201cIt is,\u201d she explains, \u201ca climate change adaptation strategy. It is better than anything else we can eat.\u201d But seaweed, Warner says, can have a massive local climate change effect. To illustrate her point, she says that when mussels are planted on ropes underwater after a kelp harvest, the shell strength is almost twice as strong in those areas, thanks to the removal of the excess carbon.\n\nUntil recently, seaweed was always sold dried and, most often, came from Asia or was harvested from the wild in U.S. waters. Atlantic Sea Farms is one of several American companies that sells seaweed that is never dyed or dried. After it is flash frozen, it\u2019s used to make kelp cubes, a nutritious boost to smoothies, salad dressings and sauces. In raw form, the seaweed adds crunch and a briny, umami-rich flavor to seaweed salad, Atlantic Sea Farms\u2019 Sea-Beet Kraut and a take on kimchi called Sea-Chi.\n\nAccording to Lia Heifetz, 31, ofBarnacle Foodsin Juneau, Alaska, \u201cseaweed is an ocean multivitamin.\u201d It\u2019s rich in potassium, iron, magnesium, calcium and antioxidants. Heifetz and her two partners harvest wild bull kelp seaweed, which is prolific around the shores of Juneau, as well as farmed kelp. Bull kelp is unique because it can grow a stipe (or stem) that is 30 feet long and, according to Heifetz, offers a unique texture and flavor similar to apples and fresh bell pepper. Barnacle Foods freezes the kelp and uses it to make hot sauce, salsa, pickles, Bloody Mary mixes and more. Heifetz hopes to increase the amount of kelp farming they do in coming years but says that in Alaska and many other parts of the country, obtaining permits and licenses involves lengthy hurdles.\n\n\u201cWe have a unique opportunity here in Alaska,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have 30,000 miles of coast in the state, primarily undeveloped. Consumers are looking for a way to use their food dollars to support causes that are important to them. And seaweed checks all the boxes.\u201d\n\nWarner has also been spreading the word about the power of seaweed. She was recently invited to the2022 Davos World Economic Forumto speak as part of a program for 20 \u201cecopreneurs.\u201d She focused her talk on America\u2019s \u201cbroken food system\u201d and the potential for Maine\u2019s seaweed aquaculture industry as \u201ca model where people and the planet come first.\u201d But mostly, she says, she tried to leave the top leaders who attended the annual summit with something positive.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing with seaweed in Maine,\u201d she told them, \u201cis giving people hope and giving people an opportunity to take hold of their own future in the face of a very uncertain climate.\u201d", "extraction_status": "success"}, {"company": "Atlantic Sea Farms", "title": "A Seaweed Crop Finds a Spot in Maine Waters", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/science/environment/seaweed-us-food-cosmetics-atlantic-sea-farms-e34b8fb5", "source": "Wall Street Journal", "body": "Seaweed is making its way into more foods, cosmetics and even pet kibble.

Then she stood back as he dug in.\n\nTimber\u2019s response was miraculous: He sniffed his options, then devoured the Cricket Crave and licked his lips contentedly, leaving the other side untouched.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those moments when you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, this is so good,\u2019 \u201d Carlson said. This summer, Petco stocked shelves in 800 stores with Jiminy\u2019s dog food. Along with the surprise of seeing pets wolf down insects, Carlson says customers often tell her, \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize I could be fighting climate change with my dog.\u201d\n\nA third of all food in the U.S. gets wasted. Fixing that could help fight climate change.\n\nMany pet owners reflexively bark \u201cNo!\u201d when their dog or cat prepares to feast on a bug. But despite what scientists call the \u201cyuck factor,\u201d insects could be a sustainable secret ingredient for the booming pet food industry. About a quarter of Americans are cutting back on eating meat, many alarmed by the fact that livestock farming causes up to 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Yet for all the humans observing meatless Mondays, opting for Impossible burgers or swearing off meat entirely, 180 million furry members of U.S. households are fed beef, lamb, poultry or pork in just about every meal.\n\nResearchers at the University of California at Los Angelesestimatethat dogs and cats account for up to 30 percent of the environmental impact of U.S. meat consumption. If American pets made up their own country, they\u2019d eat the fifth-most meat globally. And fueled by a surge of pandemic pet acquisitions, Americans now spend more than $40 billion annually on pet food and treats \u2014 with many stores offering almost exclusively traditional meat-based options.\n\nBut there are signs of a shift. Many pet food companies \u2014 including the two biggest, Mars and Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 are developing insect-based alternatives for dogs and cats, and according to a Petco survey, 55 percent of customers like the idea of using sustainable alternative protein ingredients in pet food.\n\nMillennials, the fastest-growing contingent of pet owners,are keenon buying environmentally friendly products and willing to pay a premium for them, according to Francesca Mahoney, Petco\u2019s head of sustainability.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an appetite for pet parents to spend a little bit more if something resonates with their values,\u201d Mahoney said. Petco wants half of its products to be sustainable by 2025.\n\nWould you eat insects to help save the planet? These companies are betting yes.\n\nFor now, some pet owners might balk at the higher price of these alternatives. Petco sells a 3.5-pound bag of Jiminy\u2019s Cricket Crave for $21.95 \u2014 almost three times more than Purina\u2019s chicken and rice dry food. But the cost of insects, driven up temporarily by nutritional testing and a supply chain with enormous room to scale, is expected to drop as the market grows.\n\nCarlson founded Jiminy\u2019s in 2016, after reading a United Nations report identifying crickets as a sustainable source of food for humans. After all, insects are already a culinary staple in much of the world: grasshoppers fried in Thailand, worms floating in mezcal in Mexico, caterpillars boiled in the Congo. The edible insect market isprojectedto grow eightfold globally by 2030, to $8 billion.\n\nCarlson herself drinks smoothies with a dash of cricket powder. Her company sells Cricket Crave as well as Good Grub, which derives protein from black soldier fly larvae. As a pet food, \u201cthere are no compromises,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s humane. It\u2019s hypoallergenic. It\u2019s delicious.\u201d\n\nAnd, Carlson added, insects produce something many pet owners obsessively monitor: \u201csolid poops.\u201d Crickets and fly larvae are similarly digestible to traditional meat and provide comparable protein, plus vital amino acids and other minerals, according to Kelly Swanson, an animal nutritional scientist at the University of Illinois.\n\nAlthough many pets eat the same menu of wet and dry food every day of their lives, Swanson says a rotational diet is often the most nutritious. When cutting back on meat, \u201cit\u2019s not all or nothing,\u201d he says, adding that for his own diet, \u201cI\u2019ll take out one or two meat meals per week. With pets, 10 percent of protein coming from insects adds up sustainability-wise.\u201d\n\nAn acre of land can produce about 192 pounds of beef annually, or 265 pounds of poultry, according to Carlson. The same spaceyields65,000 pounds of cricket or 130,000 pounds of black soldier fly larvae. Farming insects releases substantially less carbon and methane, and, according to Jiminy\u2019s \u201ccarbon pawprint\u201d calculator, switching a Golden Retriever to an insect-based diet saves 4.4 million gallons of water per year.\n\nMuch of Jiminy\u2019s crickets come from Entomo Farms in Ontario, Canada. The company, which expects sales to increase fourfold this year, retrofitted rural chicken farms to house millions of crickets in climate-controlled \u201ccabins.\u201d One might think a barn full of crickets would be as deafening as a Toronto Raptors playoff game, but no: Crickets only chirp in old age, and Entomo\u2019s crickets live 80 percent of their natural life span before being processed.\n\nMy name is Max, and I have a cicada problem: A tale of a dog who can\u2019t stop eating the bugs\n\nIn August, the Association of American Feed Control Officials, an influential body for establishing pet nutritional standards, voted to approve black soldier fly larvae for dog food. (AAFCO has yet to issue a verdict on crickets.) Jiminy\u2019s gets its dried fly larvae from Kentucky-based EnviroFlight, which opened the first commercial-scale U.S. fly farm in 2019. At any given time there are billions of creatures under one roof \u2014 about 5 percent flies and 95 percent larvae, living vertically up to 15 feet.\n\nFlies are raised in a \u201ccircular economy,\u201d said EnviroFlight President Liz Koutsos, an animal nutritionist. They are fed with byproducts from local bourbon distilleries and bakeries, and the waste from larvae then goes toward animal feed. \u201cNothing ends up in the landfill,\u201d Koutsos said.\n\nMany meat-based pet foods use animal byproducts humans won\u2019t eat \u2014 mostly bones and organs like the spleen, kidney and heart \u2014 supposedly reducing their footprint. Caitlyn Dudas, executive director of the Pet Sustainability Coalition, says the pet food industry would be better off dialing back its dependence on factory livestock farming. \u201cWe are not clear of responsibility for the farming practices for our products\u201d from animals, she said, whereas \u201cinsect protein is legitimately sustainable.\u201d\n\nFor now, Europeans have a greater appetite to serve insects to their pets. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Purina line of insect-based dry dog food is sold in about 200 stores in Switzerland, and the company expects distribution to double by October. This spring, Mars \u2014 having found that 47 percent of Europeans would buy insect-based cat food \u2014 launched a black soldier fly larvae-based cat kibble, Lovebug, in the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cWith protein sourcing, there is a symbiotic relationship between the human food supply chain and the pet supply chain,\u201d said Deri Watkins, president of Mars Petcare\u2019s European division. \u201cI'd be surprised if five years from now, you're not seeing the option of insect protein on a mainstream supermarket shelf.\u201d\n\nCan you eat cicadas? Yes, and here\u2019s the best way to catch, cook and snack on them.\n\nCompanies are still refining how to market insects, too. When Jonathan Persofsky performed focus-group testing for his Green Gruff cricket-based dog treats, packages covered with images of bugs scored very poorly. When he explained the nutritional and environmental upside of crickets, however, 88 percent of people said they\u2019d buy his product.\n\nMaryanne Murphy, a veterinary nutritionist at the University of Tennessee, isn\u2019t surprised that people are turned off by the sight of bugs. The pet food industry already panders to human palettes, marketing such novelties as Memphis-style BBQ chicken for dogs and seafood paella for cats. \u201cWhen I talk to [pet] owners about it, they say, \u2018Would I want to eat insects?\u2019 \u201d Murphy said.\n\nAlthough humans can easily cut back on mainstream meat options, many people question whether that\u2019s true of their pets. Cats are called \u201cobligate carnivores,\u201d meaning they depend on the micronutrients found in meat. But \u201cinsect protein fulfills that need,\u201d Watkins said, and at a minimum, cats and dogs appear to benefit from insects as a complementary protein source.\n\nD.C.-based Chippin also makes treats from cricket powder, plus dog foods made with spirulina or invasive carp. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d CEO Haley Russell said, \u201cthat you see people walking through Whole Foods, putting plant-based foods in their reusable bags, but when you hit the pet food aisle so much of it is conventional meat protein.\u201d\n\nAbout a year ago, Jonathan Carrion, owner of Brooklyn Tails Pet Food, began selling cricket treats. He liked that they\u2019re high in protein, and remembered watching his cat enjoy eating insects she found outside.\n\nBut after displaying them in the front of his store, Carrion decided not to restock. \u201cAbout 50 percent of customers thought crickets were disgusting,\u201d he said, \u201clike I told them it was made out of cockroaches.\u201d\n\nUltimately, there\u2019s still a major learning curve to overcome in the United States, even in the most environmentally conscientious neighborhoods. He thinks insect-based pet food companies should offer free samples or provide brochures, like CBD-based pet products do, to explain the many benefits of feeding insects to pets.\n\n\u201cPeople who took samples would come right back, asking, \u2018Hey, do you have any more cricket stuff?\u2019 \u201d Carrion said. \u201cAnimals love it.\u201d\n\nSign up for the latest news about climate change, energy and the environment, delivered every Thursday\n\nMore on climate change\n\nUnderstanding our climate:Global warming is a real phenomenon, and weather disasters areundeniably linked to it.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nOur dogs mean everything to us and, of course, we want them around forfur-ever. As pup parents, that means taking care of our little four-legged friends (ahem, children, really) the best we know how\u2014from regular visits to the vet and groomer to feeding them healthy foods. Since nutrition and maintaining a healthy weight are particular concerns for small dog breeds, it's really important to feed your small dog the best of the best, the healthiest of the healthiest.\n\nSo, we vetted (pun intended) the top dog foods for the smallest of our furry friends. These are the six best dog foods designed for small dog breeds.\n\nThe Farmer's Dog is one of the most popular dog food subscription services to come about in recent years, with a laser focus on nutrition and using the best\u2014meaning, the freshest\u2014ingredients possible. Owners start by taking a quiz about their dog's health, weight, breed, etc. so that TFD can personalize food to each dog's unique needs. You can then specify how often you want to feed your dog (once or twice daily) and the proper portions based on your dog's size, breed, age and weight will show up at your doorstep. It's a meaningful option for all dogs\u2014my dog is about 30 pounds, and this is what I personally feed her. But TFD is particularly good for small dog breeds, which may have more trouble maintaining a healthy weight, as well as picky eaters (as smaller dogs tend to be), and dogs with allergies. Speaking of allergies, if your dog has a chicken or turkey allergy, The Farmer's Dog beef recipe may be a better option.\n\nBuy at The Farmer's Dog.\n\nNom Nom is another convenient dog food subscription service that is personalized to your dog's individual nutrition needs. Formulated by board-certified veterinary nutritionist Dr. Justin Shmalberg, the Nom Nom Beef Mash recipe is fresh dog food made with fresh ingredients: ground beef, russet potatoes, eggs, carrots, peas and fish oil (for that shiny, shiny coat!). All of their ingredients are restaurant-quality and are sustainably sourced from their team of reliable U.S. growers and suppliers. Because the food is customizable to your dog's weight, age and breed, it's another awesome option for small breeds\u2014both adults and puppies\u2014particularly if they have trouble maintaining a healthy weight or have food allergies.\n\nBuy at Nom Nom.\n\nSmall but mighty! If that sounds like your dog, then this aptly named small breed dog food by trusted dog food brand Blue Buffalo might be the perfect fit. Real chicken is this food's first ingredient, and the formula is outfitted with omega 3 and other important fatty acids, essential vitamins and antioxidant-rich ingredients that keep your dog healthy and energized so they can keep playing catch all day long. While this dog food is better for adult doggos, it's specifically made for extra-small, small and toy breeds, so can you have peace of mind when feeding it to your pint-size pooch.\n\nBuy at Chewy.\n\nAvailable on Chewy in either a 4- or 10-pound bag, Merrick Classic Small Dog Food formula features essential vitamins, minerals and omega fatty acids for a balanced diet and, of course, real deboned chicken as its first ingredient. All of these ingredients work well together to promote healthy skin and fur, and the health of your doggy's hips and joints (which can be abig problemin some small breeds). Also free of potatoes, peas, and lentils, this food is formulated with quinoa for good digestion, making it best for small breed adult dogs.\n\nBuy at Chewy.\n\nJiminy's Good Grub Dog Food\n\nChicken, turkey, beef, salmon and even lamb\u2014these are the most popular dog food flavors we've all heard of before. But crickets?! Meet Jiminy's, a sustainable and humane dog food brand that oven bakes their insect-based dog food and treats in the U.S. Jiminy's Good Grub Dog Food is one of our favorite options for small breeds because insect protein powder combined with oats, sweet potato, flaxseed and other plant-based ingredients makes for a nutrient-dense dog food that helps keep your pup at a healthy weight. Jiminy's Good Grub Dog Food is also significantly less processed than some other dog foods. That's because while other dog food companies prefer to extrude their food (that means baking under high pressure and in heat that cooks out the nutrients your dog needs), Jiminy's uses a small-batch baking process that's sustainable and results in a more nutritious meal for Spot. Jiminy's Good Grub kibbles are also pretty small\u2014making them easily chewable and digestible for petite dogs (and their bellies).\n\nBuy at Petco.\n\nGrain-free and high-protein, Instinct Raw Boost Grain-Free Recipe With Real Chicken for Small Breed Dogs offers your small pup all the health benefits of araw dietbut in an accessible, non-yucky and long-lasting freeze-dried form. Cage-free chicken is the first protein-packed ingredient in this dog food specifically formulated for small dog breeds. It's meant to promote lean muscles and properly balance protein, fat and calories so that your tiny dog can maintain a healthy body weight. Made without grain, potato, corn, wheat, soy, artificial colors, by-product meal or preservatives, this small breed dog food can also help promote strong bones, teeth and joints thanks to high levels of calcium, phosphorus, glucosamine and chondroitin.\n\nBuy at Petco.\n\nNewsweek may earn a commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.
