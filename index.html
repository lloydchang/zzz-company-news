The watch weighs 49 grams (about 1.7 ounces). It's 1.6 inches in diameter and 0.5 inches thick.", "date": "2025-06-05", "full_content": "Our Buyers Guide Top Picks\n\nThe UnaliWear Kanega Watch is a more discreet alternative to traditional medical alert devices. The watch weighs 49 grams (about 1.7 ounces). It\u2019s 1.6 inches in diameter and 0.5 inches thick. It comes with a patented quick-swap battery, so you never have to take it off to charge.\n\nThe UnaliWear Kanega Watch is a stand-alone personal emergency response device, so you don\u2019t need a landline or cellphone to make it work. Instead, it relies on Verizon\u2019s nationwide cellular network. The watch connects to your home Wi-Fi but automatically switches to Verizon\u2019s network when you leave your home.\n\nYou can call for help in multiple ways. If you press and hold the button on the right side of the watch (called the crown button) for a couple of seconds, you\u2019ll be connected to the monitoring center. These trained professionals have your contact information and the names of your caregivers and know exactly whom to notify and where to dispatch help.\n\nYou can also use voice commands through the watch\u2019s built-in microphone. Finally, if you fall, the watch automatically detects the unusual movement and notifies the monitors.\n\nUnaliWear offers two different pricing structures for the Kanega Watch. You can make an upfront payment for the whole year, or you can pay monthly from the start. No matter how you pay, you have a one-time setup fee.\n\nAs of publishing, if you choose to pay monthly from the start, your one-time setup fee is $299. Then, you\u2019ll pay $69.95 a month for monitoring services.\n\nThere\u2019s no contract with either payment structure, so you can cancel the service anytime. But note that the watch and the accessories aren\u2019t yours to keep. You have to return everything in good condition if you cancel the monitoring service.\n\nDesigned with an older user in mind, the UnaliWear Kanega Watch has many features to help improve independence, including:\n\nCompare UnaliWear with othermedical alert companies.\n\nThe company name comes from the Cherokee words \u201cUnalii,\u201d which means friend, and \u201cKanega,\u201d which means speak. When you put them together, you have a friend who speaks to you.\n\nUnaliWear covers defects in materials and workmanship for as long as you have it, as long as you are current on your service payments. If any issues come up, UnaliWear will replace the watch for free.\n\nThe company also covers replacement and shipping at no cost the first time you break the watch. Be aware that UnaliWear does not cover replacement of a watch in all circumstances.\n\nAfter 30 days, you can cancel the service at any time as long as you return all equipment. You\u2019ll get a refund (minus a $75 restocking fee) if all equipment is returned in good condition. Annual plans will be issued a prorated refund based on the nondiscounted monthly rate of $69.95.\n\nTo cancel your monitoring service through UnaliWear, you need to call the company\u2019s customer support team. As a part of the cancellation, you must send the equipment back in good condition. A lost or damaged watch results in a fee of up to $650.\n\nThe company\u2019s headquarters is in Austin, Texas.\n\nUnaliWear helps vulnerable people enjoy more independence through its medical alert technology. The stylish Kanega Watch includes 24/7 U.S.-based monitoring, fall detection, medication reminders and a 30-day money-back guarantee. Since the watch uses Wi-Fi and LTE technologies, wearers don\u2019t need a landline to access help. In addition, UnaliWear doesn\u2019t require a long-term contract.\n\nShop with confidence\n\nCompare with top companies\n\nFilter by Rating\n\nPopular Mentions\n\nA link has directed you to this review.

My grandma lives independently and is able to continue to do so because the Kanega provides round the clock coverage in the case of an emergency. And even better, my mom can rest easy, knowing she's safe. We chose the Kanega because the 24/7 monitoring service already knows who she is when an alert comes from the watch. After doing so much research online, we found that the Kanega's coverage and service was far superior to others on the market. Totally worth the price!\n\nReviewed March 12, 2024\n\nI bought this watch for my mother in December 2023. Two months later the screen went blank and it was not usable. I made several calls and wrote emails to the company's customer service department. The calls repeatedly were answered by the \"overflow\" service department, which was not qualified to actually troubleshoot problems. After a week of no response on how to fix the watch, I returned it. If you want a watch that detects falls and will notify emergency services, I would suggest an Apple Watch. The Apple Watch does everything the Kanega does and more, and it costs less.\n\nThanks for subscribing.\n\nYou have successfully subscribed to our newsletter! Enjoy reading our tips and recommendations.\n\nReviewed Feb. 17, 2024\n\nThe watch band was too large even though the wrist measured within the range for small. And the watch was heavy, too heavy for a small person to sleep when wearing. This may work better for larger folks, but if you're small, I would not recommend it. The $75 return fee is very steep and you need to go through customer service, which tries and tries to change your mind, to return it.\n\nReviewed Nov. 15, 2023\n\nWe got the Kanega Watch for my father several years ago. He loves it and he wears it all the time, which is the total point. The fall detection has worked as advertised, and he enjoys asking his watch for the time and date. Tremendous peace of mind for him and our whole family. I highly recommend!\n\nReviewed Oct. 22, 2023\n\nI purchased the watch on 9/6/2023, I received it around 9/11/2023. I lost a battery out of it on 10/2/2023, I had no idea how I lost it. Now on 10/22/2023 the watch band has broken where it attaches with the battery to watch. Very unhappy with the construction as I bought a battery for about $36 plus shipping about 3 weeks after purchase and now about 6 weeks later it is broken. I am emailing the company today to see what they will do about this situation. I paid $918.40. I would expect a better quality.\n\nReviewed Sept. 16, 2023\n\nThe service is great. There is very little set up and it is very easy to do. Once we received the watch there were 3 very short videos to watch and then you call the center and they do a test call with you. My Aunt loves the device because it isn't a pendant that gets in the way, flops around or looks out of place when she dresses up and goes out. She also likes the fact that she never has to take it off and can wear it in the shower.\n\nOur only complaint is that after only 3 months the first watch band broke where the battery goes in. We didn't realize it cracked and one battery was lost and then the band broke all together. I believe that a more rubberized battery chamber would be a better housing for the battery. The other disappointment was we had to pay $50 for shipping for a new watch. This seems a bit steep. We haven't found anything better at this time but the shipping cost did cause the luster of this product to dull somewhat.\n\nCheck out our buyers guide top picks\n\nOur Buyers Guide Top Picks:", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Unaliwear", "title": "UnaliWear Medical Alert Watch Review In 2025", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/health/medical-alert-systems/unaliwear-review/", "source": "Forbes", "body": "Our editors also may be in touch with follow-up questions.

She retired after selling two other companies she founded, but she was inspired to rejoin the workforce to address problems faced by her mother, who was active but frail and wanted to age in place safely.\n\n\u201c[S]ome of the best stuff I think gets created because of the need, and needs are just not being met in silver tech,\u201d says Booth, noting that none of themedical alert systemsavailable in 2013 would have worked for her mother (theApple Watchdidn\u2019t hit store shelves until April 2015). \u201cThependantis super stigmatizing. And the problem is even with a pendant, you take it off at night because of the threat of choking. Yet the number one cause of injury among older adults is falls\u2014mostly in the bathroom and mostly at night,\u201d explains Booth. \u201cWe realized we could build a watch that you could wear 24/7.\u201d\n\nThe UnaliWear Kanega Watch is disguised discreetly as a digital wristwatch to avoid the potential stigma of wearing a medical alert device. It can interact with the wearer via voice, a push button and large white-on-black text on its screen. The watch is water-resistant, so users can wear it in the shower, although it\u2019s not recommended for swimming. The watch comes with four rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which can be swapped in and out without taking off the watch.\n\nWhen users first receive the watch, they provide UnaliWear with any relevant medical information.\n\nThe watch connects to the internet and an emergency response operator via Wi-Fi and runs exclusively on the Verizon 4G/5G cellular network nationwide. If an emergency occurs, (the user falls or calls for help), the watch\u2019sGPScan help locate them. It also connects them to an emergency response operator in seconds.\n\nUnaliWear\u2019s emergency response center is a U.S.-based, third-party provider that\u2019s Five Diamond certified by TMA, the monitoring industry\u2019s highest standard. The operators have each customer\u2019s provided medical information on hand to help determine what kind of help should be sent when they receive a call.\n\nTo start talking to the Kanega Watch, say, \u201cFred Astaire,\u201d and give it a command.\n\nSince no two people share identical falling patterns, the watch uses artificial intelligence (AI) to learn about each user\u2019s movements. If the watch detects what might be a fall and the wearer tells the alert center that they didn\u2019t fall, the AI learns to ignore similar movements of that user in the future.\n\nThe watch face includes a black screen with white text and comes in three accent colors: rose gold, champagne gold and black. Each watch strap is black no matter the accent color selected.\n\nUnaliWear offers two monitoring subscription options for the Kanega Watch: the annual plan and the monthly plan.\n\nFor the annual plan, users pay for device setup and 12 months of service upfront. Costs include a $199 one-time setup fee and$59.95 per month for ongoing monitoring and service. The total upfront cost is $918.40.\n\nFor the monthly plan, users pay for device setup and the first month of service upfront. Costs include a $299 one-time setup fee and$69.95 for one month of monitoring service, totaling $368.95 upfront.", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "BrainCheck", "title": "New and Real-World Research Supports BrainCheck's Cognitive Assessment and Care Planning Solutions", "url": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/new-and-real-world-research-supports-braincheck-s-cognitive-assessment-and-care-planning-solutions-1032812763", "source": "Business Insider", "body": "Clinicians and patients report high levels of satisfaction with BrainCheck's standard battery, Assess\u2122 and care planning tool, Plan\u2122 Studies confirm Assess can effectively determine severity ...", "date": "2023-11-13", "full_content": "Clinicians and patients report high levels of satisfaction with BrainCheck's standard battery, Assess\u2122 and\u00a0care planning tool, Plan\u2122\n\nStudies confirm Assess can effectively determine severity of cognitive impairment\n\nAUSTIN, Texas,Nov. 13, 2023/PRNewswire/ --BrainCheck, Inc.announced promising new and real-world data supporting BrainCheck's cognitive assessment and care planning solutions was recently presented at The Gerontological Society of America's Annual Scientific Meeting fromNovember 8-12inTampa, FL.Studies confirm clinicians and patients report high levels of satisfaction with BrainCheck's standard battery, Assess\u2122, and care planning tool, Plan\u2122.

This is the second patent in DERMALA's intellectual property portfolio that covers using the human microbiome to treat and prevent acne.\n\nAcneisthe most common skin condition that affectsover\u00a080% of adolescents. It often persists into adulthood with a negative impact on the quality of life. Acne vulgaris is characterized by microbiome dysbiosis associated with an overgrowth ofC. acnesbacteria, followed by inflammation of skin follicles. To date, many strategies have been used to treat acne. However, they often show limited efficacy accompanied by side effects, in part due to suboptimal delivery into the skin and lack of targeting.\n\nDERMALA developed a novel technology for enhanced targeted delivery of human microbiome-derived postbiotic metabolites into specific layers of the skin. This results in higher treatment efficacy due to targeted inhibition ofC. acnesin follicles and reducing inflammation while avoiding side effects.\u00a0The microbiome-derived postbiotics derived from beneficial bacteria help correct the microbiome dysbiosis associated with acne and produce faster and longer-lasting results.\n\n\"Targeted delivery is critical\u00a0for\u00a0overcoming side effects and achieving high treatment efficacy,\" said Dr. Lada Rasochova, founder and CEO of DERMALA. \"Granting of this patent recognizes the uniqueness of our delivery approach and further enhances the value of our microbiome technology as it allows for formulating microbiome-derived ingredients into specific, efficacious, and effective topical products\".\n\nThis patent is an important part of the fast-expanding DERMALA's intellectual property portfolio which focuses on using the human microbiome for improving skin health and treating skin conditions like acne and eczema.\n\nAbout DERMALADERMALA, Inc. is aSan Diego-based consumer dermatology company leveraging a scientific understanding of the human microbiome and data analytics to develop novel treatments for chronic skin conditions.

Designed and supported by doctors and psychologists, the first-of-its-kind evidence-based platform grants women groundbreaking access to information and interventions to solve their sexual health problems.\n\nFounder and CEO, Board-certified Ob/Gyn, Dr. Lyndsey Harper, M.D., FACOG, IF, started Rosy after recognizing that 43% of women had a sexual health problem but were met with a complete lack of resources when trying to solve these important issues. In 2019, Dr. Harper launched Rosy with the goal of putting sexual health education and tools in the hands of women everywhere.\n\n\"It's time women feel empowered to talk about sexual health issues and have access to convenient solutions,\" said Dr. Harper. \"I created Rosy to revolutionize the way women and their providers think about, talk about, and treat women's sexual problems.\"\n\nRecent studies validate Rosy's approach and highlight how the company stands apart from other platforms in the space. In a 2020 study, results showed that Rosy users experienced statistically significant improvements in many aspects of sexual function including desire, arousal, orgasm, and lubrication. More recently, in a study from Mount Sinai Hospital presented at the American Urogynecology Society Annual Meeting, Dr. Alexandra Dubinskaya et al. concluded that \"only one App was approved to be recommended to patients by experts in the field,\" and that app was Rosy. This has been echoed in the medical community with more than 6% of ob/gyns in the country now recommending Rosy to their patients\n\nThe women's health technology company secured $2 million in funding in its seed round led by Austin-based True Wealth Ventures with additional participation from Portfolia's Femtech II Fund and Mindshift Capital.

It was during this time that she realized how confusing maternal healthcare really is.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the things I was talking to my clients about \u2014 like the digital front door and how we build around patient-centered outcomes and multidisciplinary care models \u2014 were really absent when it came to my maternal care journey,\u201d Doyle said in an interview. \u201cThat made a big impression on me.\u201d\n\nTo ensure effective cost mitigation, employers can\u2019t wait for the market to adjust \u2014 they have to punch first.\n\nWhat was absent was care for needs other than actual pregnancy care, like mental health and physical therapy. Postpartum care was also seriously lacking. Drawing from her experience, Doyle went on to create Chicago-basedPartum Healthin 2020.Judges crowned Partum Health the winner of the consumer/employer track of theMedCity News INVEST Pitch Perfect conteston May 24, preferring it over four other companies.\n\nPartum Health, a direct-to-consumer company, supports families during fertility, pregnancy and postpartum. It currently only serves patients in Illinois, but is looking to expand nationally. It offers doula care (during birth and postpartum), lactation consultants, physical therapy, nutrition support, mental health services and acupuncture. Patients can meet with the care team in the provider\u2019s office, the patient\u2019s home or via telehealth. They can also chat with the care team through Partum\u2019s app.\n\n\u201cI think the reality is, if you want to have a great postpartum experience, you actually have to start planning and doing preventative care during your pregnancy,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cThen we also know that, for example, when people are in the midst of fertility treatments, there\u2019s a really high incidence of mental health challenges, and also nothing really built into that care delivery to bring mental health side-by-side with your fertility journey. There may also be instances where people need support with the physical side from [physical therapy], things like nutrition, that can really aid in supporting optimal fertility, pregnancy and postpartum.\u201d\n\nPartum Health was chosen as the winner of the Pitch Perfect contest because it is filling an \u201cunmet market need,\u201d said Shawn Ellis, managing partner ofDistributed Venturesand a judge for the contest.\n\nRadiologists today face a surge in imaging volume and pressure to produce fast, accurate reports. Workflow optimization is about delivering the right results at the right time with less friction.\n\n\u201cThere was a consensus that Partum is coordination of different specialist care that\u2019s really, really needed during pregnancy and post pregnancy,\u201d Ellis said. \u201c[I] loved the coordination of care, loved the very consumer-centric approach, patient-centric approach.\u201d\n\nWhile Partum is a direct-to-consumer company, it is in-network with Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Cigna for its clinical services. It functions in a fee-for-service model, in which clinical care is usually reimbursed through insurance and non-clinical services like doula care is paid out of pocket or through a health savings account or flexible spending account.Down the line, the company aims to engage in more payer relationships (including Medicaid), as well as work with employers.\n\nPartum has received interest from investors as well, raising a little over $1 million in a pre-seed round from angel investors. The startup is currently raising\u00a0its seed round.\n\nOther maternal health companies are gaining funding as well. Maven Clinic raised$90 millionin Series E funding in November. The company offers care including fertility, maternity and pediatric support. Oula \u2014 which provides midwifery, obstetrics and pregnancy education \u2014 raised more than$19 millionin January.\n\nPartum Health\u2019s ultimate goal is to expand the scope of what\u2019s considered needed in pregnancy care, Doyle said.\n\n\u201cOur aim is that every family \u2014 just like you see an obstetrician or you see a reproductive endocrinologist if you\u2019re going through fertility \u2014 they also have access to mental health and physical therapy and doula care,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the shift that we\u2019re trying to create. The default model really needs to be expanded to include these specialists because that\u2019s what the families are looking for. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to move the needle on the health complications and issues that people are experiencing today.\u201d\n\nPhoto: MedCity News", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Partum Health", "title": "Partum Health Expands to Dallas, On A Mission to Elevate Maternal Care Throughout Texas", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/partum-health-expands-dallas-mission-124100615.html", "source": "Yahoo Finance", "body": "Partum Health was founded with a mission to change the standard of maternal care after its founders witnessed the huge gap between the care they needed and what they actually received during their ...", "date": "2024-08-21", "full_content": "The maternal health start-up provides expert support for growing families through proactive care from pre-conception through early parenthood.\n\nCHICAGO,Aug. 21, 2024/PRNewswire/ --Partum Health, theChicago-based maternal health startup that offers direct-to-consumer interdisciplinary pregnancy and postpartum care, is expanding toDallas, the brand's third market. Partum was founded inChicagoin 2021 and expanded toHoustoninNovember 2023afterraising$3.1 millionin seed funding.\n\nInthe United States, more women die each year of pregnancy-related complications than in any other developed country, with the majority of those deaths happening between one week and one year of giving birth. And inTexas, the need is especially acute. A2022 studypublished by the Texas Medical Association ranked the state 50th among all states in access to high-quality prenatal and maternal care, citing barriers to health care before and after their hospital stay as a key factor. Moreover, areportlast year by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission found that 90% of the state's pregnancy-related deaths are preventable, recommending an improvement in care coordination and access to comprehensive health services to achieve better outcomes.\n\nPartum Health was founded with a mission to change the standard of maternal care after its founders witnessed the huge gap between the care they needed and what they actually received during their own families' perinatal experiences.\n\nIn addition to a comprehensive network of postpartum specialty providers across lactation, mental health, physical therapy and more, Partum families also have a dedicated care coordinator. This go-to contact helps parents make informed decisions, schedule appointments, navigate insurance and is available 24/7 via text. To help remove barriers to access, Partum's services are available virtually and in-home to meet the dynamic needs of modern families.\n\n\"We built Partum to help bridge the gap in comprehensive maternal health and improve outcomes during the critical postpartum period. Our offerings are focused on preventing the most common complications of pregnancy, including perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and avoidable C-sections, among others. We look forward to partnering with OBs and Midwives acrossDallas/Fort Worthto provide wraparound, interdisciplinary care to their patients,\" saidMeghan Doyle, co-founder and CEO of Partum Health.\n\nTo support its launch inDallas, Partum is hosting gatherings to engage local communities around women's health.Collaborative Care in Women's Healthwill bring together women's health providers across the spectrum of care to discuss how to better integrate in service of improved patient outcomes.Reconnecting and Finding Intimacywill convene experts for an honest discussion on social and emotional wellbeing postpartum. Partum will also be meeting with local expectant families at the Prego Expo Convention.\n\nAbout Partum Health\n\nPartum Health believes all families deserve comprehensive, whole-person care that supports their mental, physical and emotional health needs throughout the pregnancy and postpartum experience. Through digital care coordination and patient education as well as interdisciplinary services offered virtually and in person by expert care providers, Partum Health makes this a reality for families.

Everyday Health independently vets all ...", "date": "2024-11-18", "full_content": "When you have social anxiety, counseling itself is a form of exposure therapy. My oldest son is 16 and has been dealing with symptoms ofsocial anxietyandobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)for about two years. He\u2019s been under the care of a psychiatrist, but none of the online therapy we\u2019ve tried has seemed to stick. Speaking with a counselor adds to his anxiety: On days when he has an appointment, he\u2019ll spend the hours leading up to it stressing and fretting.\n\nHe\u2019s tried two large mainstream online therapy platforms, chosen because he could communicate with the therapist via live chat during sessions or message a therapist without having set appointment times. These services didn\u2019t seem to help him very much, and he never wanted to continue with them for longer than a month or so. Chat and messaging may be less intimidating ways to communicate with a counselor, but they also make it harder for the patient and therapist to get to know each other.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\nSo, for the sake of this review, I convinced my teen to try Fort Health, even though it only offers more traditional face-to-face video therapy sessions. Fort Health provides online therapy and psychiatry/medication management for people ages 4 to 24 in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Caregiver coaching services are also available. We tested Fort Health\u2019s child therapy services for nearly a month. This is how it went.\n\nFort Health\u2019s services are covered by most major insurance plans, including Optum, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Cigna, Evernorth, Oxford Health Plans, Horizon BlueCross BlueShield, Geisinger Health Plan, and Humana. Medicaid is not accepted.\n\nOther plans may also be accepted; contact Forth Health customer service to confirm your coverage. If your plan is accepted, you\u2019ll only pay a copay or coinsurance payment. I paid the standard copayment for specialists on my insurance plan, which is $50.\n\nIf paying out of pocket, the company uses the pay-per-appointment model; there are no subscriptions or bundling options. Therapy is $180 for the initial evaluation session and $150 for subsequent 55-minute sessions. Psychiatry is $400 for the initial 60-minute evaluation and $200 for each 30-minute follow-up session. The caregiver coaching course is $149 for two 30-minute sessions and 10 short video lessons. The site asserts that if the caregiver course is undertaken as an addition to your child\u2019s therapy, it may be covered by your insurance plan.\n\nTo sign up for service at Fort Health, I simply clicked on the teal \u201cFind Care Now\u201d button on the homepage. This opens a new tab and begins a series of questions.\n\nFirst it asks who you are seeking care for, with two choices: \u201cI am a caregiver scheduling care for my child\u201d or \u201cI am between 18 and 24, looking for care for myself.\u201d I appreciated this distinction because I\u2019ve signed up for online therapy services for my son before where the platform assumed I was the person seeking care. That meant there was no separate portal for me to log into as a parent, which felt intrusive to my son\u2019s privacy in a way that might hamper his ability to speak freely with the therapist.\n\nNext I was prompted to choose among the three states where Fort Health is available: New York, New Jersey, or Pennsylvania. It also asked me to indicate my child\u2019s age group: child, tween, teen, or young adult. This helped the service match my son with a provider with experience and expertise in the appropriate age group.\n\nSeveral questions ask about what brings your child into therapy. I had the option to choose as many items as applicable from options like school problems, anxiety, depression, attention difficulties, disruptive behavior, grief, unhealthy screen behaviors, sleep issues, trauma, body image, autism, social issues, and substance misuse. It also asks if any of these situations apply to the child within the previous six months: mental health-related hospitalization, suicide attempt, violent behavior resulting in safety concerns for them or others, disordered eating, using someone else\u2019s prescription medication or taking too much of their own medication, having excessive energy to the point of rarely sleeping, or hearing or seeing things others don\u2019t.\n\nThen I was asked whether I was seeking therapy, medication management, or both. At that point, I was able to search for my insurance plan and enter those details. I also submitted a photo of the front and back of my health insurance card so Fort Health could begin the process of confirming my insurance.\n\nI then filled in open-ended questions about my availability. The service needed a time when my son and I were available for an initial therapy evaluation session and for our ongoing weekly availability for a regular session. It explained that my son would attend therapy on his own, so this availability should be his. The service then worked to pair my son with a provider who had an open slot that aligned with my son\u2019s availability so he could continue to have a session at the same time each week.\n\nFinally, I was asked to enter my name, contact information, and preferred communication form and then schedule a time to receive a call from an intake coordinator to book the first appointment and discuss my son\u2019s therapist match. Call slots were available on weekdays at various times between 10 a.m. and 2:45 p.m. as soon as the following business day, but I could also choose to schedule it several weeks or months out if needed. I booked one for within a few days. The entire sign-up process took about 15 minutes.\n\nUpon completion of the sign-up process, I received an email welcoming me to the Fort Health community. It included a link to a short informational video by the company\u2019s clinical director. It also said, \u201cTo get started with care, call this number.\u201d I was a little confused by this since I was told the next step would be to receive a scheduled call from the company, not make a call. I didn\u2019t call the number and was contacted by the intake representative at the scheduled time, so I guess it wasn\u2019t necessary. Still, I appreciated this more personalized email confirmation of signing up for a service consultation.\n\nThe intake coordinator called me promptly at the scheduled time. They were friendly and helpful and seemed happy to answer any questions I had. She said Fort Health had five therapists and two psychiatrists licensed in Pennsylvania and accepting of UnitedHealthcare insurance, though two of these therapists were not accepting new clients at the moment.\n\nShe matched us with a therapist who had ongoing weekly availability during the weekday afternoon time slot I indicated on the sign-up form. The intake coordinator didn\u2019t tell me about her licensure or credentials, and I forgot to ask. Her public profile on the Fort Health site only says she is an LMHC (licensed mental health counselor) and licensed child therapist. Most of the providers advertised on the site are LMHCs, licensed professional counselors (LPCs), or licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs). The site also employs MDs and psychiatric nurse practitioners to provide psychiatry and medication services.\n\n[4]\n\nThe intake coordinator told me she was sending over paperwork that I would need to complete at least 48 hours ahead of the appointment. Appointments are available as late as 7:30 p.m. on weekdays, and client services can be reached until 6:30 p.m. Of course, because this is a child therapy service, afternoon and evening times are highly popular during the school year.\n\nI received an email immediately after this call confirming my appointment for the initial therapy evaluation. There were two big blue buttons to click on to either join the video session or set up our account. I also received an email that our insurance was confirmed.\n\nI then set up our account in the patient portal, filled in the necessary intake paperwork, and input my payment information for copays. I entered my son\u2019s contact and biographical information, such as date of birth, gender, etc. I was pleased to see the diverse gender identification options: Female, Male, Trans Man, Trans Woman, Genderqueer, Other, or Choose Not to Disclose. I then answered a series of open-ended questions about my son\u2019s mental health and medical history, such as any medications he\u2019s currently taking and any previous experience with therapy. I was also asked to share my concerns relating to my son\u2019s mental health. I appreciated that these sections were all fillable boxes rather than multiple choice.\n\nNext, I signed the consent for disclosure for minors form indicating my agreement to allow the therapist to share notes with my son\u2019s primary care provider. This is recommended, but it\u2019s not required. Then came the cancellation policy, which noted that patients who do not cancel at least 48 hours prior to\u00a0their appointment or who do not show up to their appointment will be charged a $90 fee.\n\nFinally came Fort Health\u2019s contact information and virtual therapy guidelines, such as how to help your child prepare for therapy sessions and the importance of them having a dedicated, distraction-free area with a closed door, a computer, and a comfortable chair for the session. The use of phones for attending virtual sessions is discouraged.\n\nMy son said he received a text with a short survey about how he was feeling after I put his information into the intake forms.\n\nBut a few days before the appointment, I got an email and a text saying my appointment may be canceled due to incomplete paperwork. I logged into the portal and looked over the paperwork section. The insurance section said it was marked \u201cskipped\u201d by the intake coordinator since our insurance had already been confirmed. I assumed this was what was triggering the messages. I received no further warnings, and the appointment still existed in the portal as of the day before, so I assumed everything was all set.\n\nFort Health uses the Healthie platform for its user portal. There is no button for logging in to be found on the main Fort Health website, so to make this easier on myself I could either bookmark the Healthie site or log in via one of the emails I had received from Fort Health regarding my appointment. Healthie is available on a desktop browser and as an app.\n\nThe patient portal is essentially the same on a browser or the app. It\u2019s very minimal. I could message the therapist, view or submit paperwork, upload documents, find billing information, edit my account or payment details, do a test video session, view my and my son\u2019s upcoming appointments, and make an appointment. When I clicked on a scheduled appointment, I could reschedule it, cancel it, or join it at the allotted time. The only thing I felt was missing in the portal was the ability to view our therapist\u2019s credentials and bio.\n\nMy son and I both received multiple reminder emails and texts in the days leading up to our appointments to ensure we remembered to attend.\n\nOur initial therapy evaluation appointment, which my son and I both attended, went very well. Our therapist explained treatment expectations at the service and that sessions occur once a week for 55 minutes, with patients attending by phone in case of emergency. She went over the cancellation policy again and noted that more than 10 minutes late was considered a no-show. Subsequent appointments would always be made with the therapist at the end of each session, with the expectation that they would generally be at the same time and day every week.\n\nShe explained that Fort Health uses a shorter-term approach than some other services: A full course of treatment is only expected to last 12 to 20 weeks. In addition, caregivers are expected to attend a 30-minute session with their child\u2019s therapist every two to four weeks. She said this would likely be covered by our insurance and should take place during the daytime hours to save the afternoon and evening slots for children\u2019s appointments.\n\n[5]\n\nThe therapist then asked us about what brought us to therapy. It was clear that she\u2019d read the intake information I\u2019d submitted, which I appreciated. She was very upfront about Fort Health not having any providers who specialized in treating OCD. She even gave us the name of another online service that could help us. Though she assured us that she could help with social anxiety, she understood we may not want to continue with the service because they could not treat OCD. This is something I had never encountered at an online therapy platform before: admission of a lack of specialization and encouragement to seek help elsewhere. I can\u2019t imagine any of the big online therapy platforms doing anything but happily accepting my money.\n\nI said since our insurance was accepted and my son\u2019s biggest issue at the moment was how social anxiety was making school miserable, we would happily try a few sessions.\n\nIn addition to treating all types of anxiety, Fort Health asserts it can help with:\n\nWhile the individual therapy sessions are meant to be between just the child and therapist, my son was nervous, so our therapist assured us I could be there at the beginning to help him transition into the appointment. This was probably the least stressed my son has ever been in a live therapy session. He was comfortable talking to her, which made therapy feel less anxiety-provoking.\n\nHe said the therapist controlled the conversation well and prevented the dreaded awkwardness of long quiet pauses. She was skilled at putting him at ease and helping him be less anxious about talking to a therapist in the first place. She taught him actionable strategies to calm down when he feels those physical symptoms of anxiety start to kick in. These can help prevent him from getting to the point of feeling overwhelmed.\n\nWe scheduled two subsequent sessions at the end of the appointment.\n\nOur second regular session was canceled because the provider was ill. I received a phone call and an email at 9:30 a.m. letting me know that our provider was out sick and our appointment later that afternoon was canceled. While I would\u2019ve preferred we get a make-up session later the same week, I understand that schedules are tight and it likely isn\u2019t possible to reschedule and still fit in a full day of sessions within the next two days.\n\nBecause we\u2019ve had such a good experience with our provider so far, this cancellation didn\u2019t bother me. We still plan to meet with her at the same time next week.\n\nAlso on offer at Fort Health are child psychiatry services and caregiver coaching services. Psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse practitioners at Fort Health can prescribe psychotropic medications appropriate for children via an initial evaluation appointment and regular follow-ups. Caregiver coaching consists of two 30-minute sessions and multiple short educational videos. We did not test these services.\n\nRescheduling upcoming appointments is easy in the Fort Health portal \u2014 as long as your provider has availability within the week that works with your schedule. Otherwise you would likely just cancel your appointment for that week and see your therapist the following week as usual. Since services are charged per appointment and there are no subscriptions, you would simply not make any further appointments with Fort Health to end services. You must cancel or reschedule your appointment with at least 48 hours\u2019 notice, though. The site literally won\u2019t let you cancel or reschedule if it\u2019s less than that. In this case, you can message your provider to reschedule within the week if possible to avoid the cancellation charge.\n\nFort Health is a much smaller operation than many online therapy companies, both in terms of how many providers it employs and the number of states where it\u2019s available. Compared to huge platforms likeTalkspaceorBetterHelp/Teen Counseling(whose teen therapy services we\u2019ve also tried), Fort Health feels very much like a boutique, personalized experience.\n\nBetween the phone call with an intake coordinator and the openness of the therapist about their specialization, Fort Health felt much more like a virtual version of a local therapy office. Still, even though the company is smaller, we still didn\u2019t have to join a waiting list and found a therapist with availability within a week of signing up. When signing up for both Talkspace and BetterHelp, you feel more like just another number than a person. While Talkspace accepted our insurance and offers psychiatry/medication management services, BetterHelp doesn\u2019t accept any insurance and only provides therapy.\n\nBoth Talkspace and BetterHelp can only treat teenagers (age 13 and up), while Fort Health can treat children as young as age 4. Only a few other online therapy services treat children this young. Little Otter treats ages 0 to 14, so it is geared toward the younger crowd: My 16-year-old would be too old. Plus, it\u2019s only available in a few states. LifeStance Health can treat kids of any age and also offers family therapy, but it\u2019s not available nationwide, and therapist availability can vary widely between states.\n\nDoctor On Demandoffers therapy and psychiatry/medication management services to people of all ages and accepts insurance. I like Doctor On Demand: It\u2019s what my son uses for psychiatry, and I have used it for therapy. The providers are caring and professional, and I appreciate that it also has a pay-per-appointment model like Fort Health.Amwellis another platform similar to Doctor On Demand that offers mental and medical care appointments. Amwell can provide therapy to kids as young as age 10. Both Doctor On Demand and Amwell are available nationwide.\n\nI would definitely recommend Fort Health to anyone looking for short-term online mental health services for their child as well as coaching and support for themselves as caregivers. The company serves a wide range of ages, accepts insurance, offers personalized service, and (despite its smaller size) has plenty of provider availability. I really appreciate being able to message with the provider through the patient portal: Therapist messaging isn\u2019t something that\u2019s usually found at these smaller companies. However, I do wish I could see more detailed provider profiles there as well. This would be especially helpful if I was looking to switch providers.\n\nMy son says he has been using the strategies his therapist taught him at school and that he is willing to continue working with this therapist after the testing period. This speaks volumes. Honestly, it\u2019s a small miracle. He usually can\u2019t get me to cancel an online therapy service fast enough and has never found a therapist who has made him feel so at ease about therapy itself and who has offered such concrete, actionable strategies for managing his anxiety. I believe this service can definitely help my son get control of his anxiety and make school more bearable.\n\nThat said, if your child has a diagnosis like OCD or something else outside the company\u2019s stated wheelhouse, it may not be a good fit for you \u2014 and the service will likely advise you of this. It\u2019s also not the service for you if you need a long-term therapy solution. The company considers 12 to 20 weeks of therapy a full course of treatment.\n\nFort Health\u2019s privacy policyis easily accessible and written in plain language instead of legalese. It doesn\u2019t contain anything that alarms me. It states: \u201cWe believe that your health information should have heightened privacy protections, which is also required by federal and state laws. All collection, use, and disclosure of your health information through the Site is governed by Professionals\u2019 Health Information Privacy Policy.\u201d\n\nHere at Everyday Health, we\u2019re testing more than 65 different online therapy companies in order to find the very best ones for your needs. We\u2019re testing them all in the same way \u2014 by doing reporting to vet the company and its business practices, by interviewing and speaking with a dozen different licensed therapists, by surveying real online therapy users, and by testing each service with professional journalists and/or therapists.\n\nTo assess this service, we looked at its quality of care, ease of sign-up, prices, intake process, therapist qualifications, and the user-friendliness of its platform.

It turns out that the ...", "date": "2022-11-07", "full_content": "ByDavid Riemer,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nAnne Carlson, founder and CEO ofJiminy\u2019s, was two years into building her new, sustainable pet food company, before she was able to tell the story of why she created it. It turns out that the story was too emotional for Carlson to share in public. It was a classic \u201cpurpose story\u201d that began with an upsetting conversation Carlson had with her adult daughter about the future of our planet. The conversation was the \u201cinciting incident\u201d in her story that led the former Del Monte executive to tackle climate change by identifying new sources of protein for pet food\u2014starting with crickets. Since creating the company, Carlson and her team have raised $6 million in seed money, secured distribution in 1,100 Petco stores, built a direct-to-consumers business and generated millions in annual revenue. Now, as Carlson looks to raise a Series A to help dramatically scale the business, she has a new storytelling challenge.\n\nBut this startup story starts with Carlson\u2019s origin story.\n\nWhile at Del Monte, Carlson helped aggregate and sell its pet food assets and rebrand them as Big Heart Pet Brands. In 2016, the J.M. Smucker Company bought the new pet brand, and Carlson moved on to think about her next thing. Around this time, Carlson had a conversation that most parents eventually have with their adult children about whether they hope to have kids one day. Carlson\u2019s daughter answered, \u201cno.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t want to bring them into a world that was devolving due to climate change. Carlson was heartbroken. She wished her daughter would experience the same joy she had raising a family. And she might have felt a bit guilty as well about not doing enough to change the narrative. Looking back, Carlson says, \u201cI realized that I couldn\u2019t just do a normal job after that\u2014building a better future for her was everything.\u201d\n\nBecause of Carlson\u2019s experience in the pet food business, she knew thatan estimated 25%-35%of domestic meat production was used to feed dogs and cats. Dogs alone consume 32 billion pounds of protein annually. The environmental impact of feeding pets in the U.S. is huge, because of the massive amount of land, water and feed required to raise cows and chickens. In researching alternatives, Carlson discovered that insects, especially crickets, are a tremendous source of protein that require a fraction of the resources required to produce traditional meat products. Cricket production, by example, generates 99% lessgreenhouse gasthan chicken production. Jiminy\u2019s was created to address this macro problem. In Carlson\u2019s early pitches, she focused on this big picture story.\n\nBut this is where things get more complicated and the real storytelling challenge emerges. The story that inspired Carlson to start the company is a memorable way to introduce Jiminy\u2019s, but to raise a series A, she must also convince investors that there\u2019s a massive market of pet owners willing to feed their dogs insect-based food. This is a common challenge for the founder who has a great origin story for their business. They\u2019ve told ustheirstory, but they\u2019ve yet to introduce the true protagonist in their product story. There has to be acustomerwith a set of needs that only Jiminy\u2019s can solve.\n\nThe good news for Carlson is that millennial and Gen Z pet owners are extraordinarily conscious of \u2014 and troubled by \u2014 the causes of climate change; and they\u2019re knowledgeable about emerging solutions. They also make-up nearly half the dog ownership in the U.S. Now Carlson has the protagonist for her new story.\n\nJiminy's Chewy Cricket Treat\n\nJiminy's 2022\n\nCarlson tells the story of Lauren, a millennial Jiminy\u2019s customer who refers to her dog Mordecai as \u201cher son.\u201d Lauren, like Carlson\u2019s daughter, is extremely worried about climate change so much so that she uses the \u201cgreener\u201d peer-to-peer videoconferencing solutionCrewdleinstead of Zoom for her work and non-profit board meetings. That\u2019s the big picture stuff. But when it comes to Mordecai, an adorable deaf rescue pup, Lauren\u2019s concerned about her dog\u2019s gut health. Mordecai isn\u2019t a lot of fun to be around, when suffering from stomach ailments. Lauren also wants meal options she can provide her pet throughout the day. Custom meal services are expensive and have way too much packaging. She\u2019d be delighted to try a more sustainable pet food, if it was healthy for the dog and came in different formats. Lauren\u2019s heard that insects are an emerging source of protein and she\u2019s willing to try something new.\n\nJiminy\u2019s answers the call. Jiminy\u2019s is asustainable pet foodusing insect protein. Once a customer like Lauren switches from a traditional meat-based pet food to Jiminy\u2019s, for example, it could save 200,000 to 2,000,000 gallons of water every year depending on the size of the dog and whether it had been eating chicken or beef based food (Jiminy\u2019s offers aneco-calculatorto figure this out). The food is nutritious, prebiotic and hypoallergenic. It includes fiber, iron, vitamin B2 and 12. And finally, Jiminy\u2019s offers a host of products from wet food to treats that can feed a dog throughout the day.\n\nFor her roadshow, Carlson will lead with her emotional origin story and quickly pivot to Lauren\u2019s story. Prospective investors will learn why Carlson is so passionate about creating a new pet brand to fight climate change, and why customers like Lauren are buying it. Lauren says, \u201csince switching (brands), Mordecai is a whole new dog. He's healthier, his fur is softer, his breath is better, and we can now breathe around him!\u201d And Lauren also feels like she\u2019s doing her part for the planet. It\u2019s a powerful one-two punch that Carlson hopes will help her raise an $8 million series A to expand her business and promote a healthier future one dog at a time.", "extraction_status": "cached"}, {"company": "Jiminy's", "title": "Pets eat a lot of meat.

As eco-friendly alternatives (particularly alternative proteins) establish themselves in our grocery aisles, the pet aisle may not be far behind. One particular ingredient is emerging as a promising option for our furry friends: insects.\n\nInsectshave gotten a lot of attentionin the past decade or so as a mega-efficient, protein-rich superfood of the future. A number of cuisines, particularly in Asia, Africa, and South America, have included insects for thousands of years, but many people remain squeamish about the idea of eating bugs. Dogs don\u2019t have the same hangups.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.Become one.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please considerdisabling your ad-blockerto allow ads on Grist.Here's How\n\nAnne Carlson, the founder and CEO ofJiminy\u2019s, discovered this when she began experimenting with bringing insect protein to the pet food industry. She started with cricket treats \u2014 which dogs went crazy for \u2014 then worked with scientists and veterinarians to determine if crickets and \u201cgrubs,\u201d or black soldier fly larvae, could provide complete nutrition for dogs. Studies showed that they could, and that the bugs also offered an array of compelling health benefits. (Her team is pursuing similar research for cats.) But Carlson was always looking at it from the angle of curbing emissions. For her, it was a personal matter.\n\nIn 2016, after a stint working for a big pet food company, Carlson was pondering her next move. A conversation with her then-college-aged daughter gave Carlson a new outlook on her career when her daughter said she didn\u2019t want to have kids. \u201cHer reason was she was worried about what the world was going to be like by the time they grew up,\u201d Carlson says. \u201cAnd she was talking about climate change.\u201d\n\nCarlson felt a pressing sense of responsibility to be part of creating a world in which her daughter would want to raise children. \u201cI actually decided right then that no matter what I did, it was going to be fighting climate change,\u201d she recalls. She founded Jiminy\u2019s later that year. Today, the company offers dry and wet dog food and treats made of insects; its products are available in around1,400 pet storesnationwide and online through popular retailers like Chewy. Although several other companies now offer insect protein treats, Jiminy\u2019s remains the only company in the U.S. selling bug-based dog food.\n\nWe talked to Carlson about her journey to bring a more sustainable form of protein to the pet market, and what she sees as the future of the industry. Her responses have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.Become one.\n\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please considerdisabling your ad-blockerto allow ads on Grist.Here's How\n\nQ. Tell me about the Jiminy\u2019s origin story. How did you get the idea to launch an alt-protein company for pets?\n\nA.A little bit after that conversation [with my daughter], I got approached to lead a pet food company. They were framing it as a sustainable alternative for pets. It was grass-fed beef. I absolutely fell in love with this idea of sustainability and pets, but I was like, \u201cYou know what? Cows are never gonna be the answer.\u201d I started thinking, \u201cWhat could be a protein source that would be sustainable for pets? And could it be humane as well?\u201d Because that would be awesome. When you look at traditional protein, it\u2019s pretty terrible from a lot of different perspectives.\n\nI started throwing different types of protein sources onto a page. I actually put an insect on the page. I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know what inspired me to do it, but I kept coming back to it. Then I saw that theU.N. had done a studysaying that insects could be the answer to world hunger.\n\nI ordered roasted crickets online. When I got them, I fed them to my dogs to see what they would do. And the drool started right away. I knew I had something that was gonna work. When you think about a dog \u2014 I don\u2019t know, do you have a dog?\n\nQ. I do!\n\nA.You know if the drool starts, they\u2019re really loving something. And it was flowing freely. Of course, I had to try it, too. I tried the crickets \u2014 and they tasted good! It was a little scary the first time I put it in my mouth, but once you get past that, you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, it tastes like a sunflower seed.\u201d It\u2019s nutty, it\u2019s earthy. We were kind of off to the races at that point.\n\nQ. So you were inspired by the U.N. study about insects as a solution for human diets, and you translated that to pet food. How did that work?\n\nA.We started with the crickets, because they are the easiest to wrap your head around. We like to call them the gateway bug \u2014 but when you look at it, you can see it is a fantastic protein source. It has all of the amino acids that you need to be a complete protein. When you\u2019re working with dogs, you\u2019re looking for 10 essential amino acids, and this delivers it in the quantities that you need. So I knew it was a good protein source, but then you start digging into it and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, but it also has minerals and vitamins and fiber.\u201d All of these other things make it into even more than just a protein source. It really is a superfood.\n\nAnd what I loved about working with the dogs is that I felt like I could have a huge impact quickly, if I was able to make a food that was complete and balanced that they could eat every day. Because if you think about it, if I were to make something for people \u2014 like, say I make a breakfast bar. Best-case scenario, even if you ate it every single day, I\u2019d only be impacting about 7 percent of your eating occasions. But if I make a food for dogs, I can impact 80 to 90 percent of their eating occasions with one product.\n\nQ. That makes sense. Speaking of the impact, could you give me a quick rundown of some of the benefits of farming insects instead of livestock?\n\nA.You bet. It\u2019s kind of fun, actually. Let me just give you sort of an analogy here: If you had an acre of land and you put cows on it, at the end of a year, you\u2019re gonna get 192 pounds of protein. If you had chickens, you get 265 pounds of protein. But if you had crickets?Sixty-five thousandpounds of protein at the end of the year. And grubs, over a million pounds of protein. [Statistics come from alifecycle assessment by insect producer EnviroFlight.] And there\u2019s a lot of reasons why. They have a shorter lifespan. For crickets, it\u2019s approximately six weeks. They also reproduce at a super-high rate. So if you think about a cow, it\u2019s having one to two babies at a time and it takes nearly a year to gestate, but grubs are laying 500 eggs at a time.\n\n[Read more: Scientists are \u201cmilking\u201d microbes to create cow-free dairy products.]\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s really cool is that there\u2019s no waste. You\u2019re using the entire animal. They\u2019re roasted and ground and the entire animal is used. Even their bedding [and excrement] is used. That\u2019s what they call frass,which is this amazing fertilizer.\n\nQ. Jiminy\u2019s is a pioneer and remains the only U.S. company offering complete-diet dog food made from insect protein. What were some of the challenges getting started?\n\nA.The biggest challenge was proving that it was safe for the dogs. You could look at the nutritional analysis on it, but there was still a question as to whether or not the dogs could actually digest it. We worked with Iowa State andAnimalBiometo doa bunch of studies, and they were all published and peer reviewed. And all of that went into proving that it was safe to use in a food.\n\nWhen we started, we focused on treats. In order to do the food, we had to do all those studies \u2014 we knew it was really important to be able to prove that it was truly digestible and it had utility. And the great news is, what we found is that it is as digestible for dogs as chicken or beef. The other thing we were able to prove is that, because it\u2019s got that fiber that comes from the exoskeleton, that feeds the good bacteria in the dog\u2019s gut. It\u2019s also hypoallergenic \u2014 for dogs that have food allergies, oftentimes this is a great solve for them.\n\nQ. What has been the reaction from pet owners in the five years that Jiminy\u2019s products have been on the market?\n\nA.It\u2019s kind of funny, it\u2019s really shifted. At the beginning, when we would say we\u2019re making dog treats with cricket protein, almost always, it was like, \u201cWait, what?\u201d You\u2019d have to explain that cricket protein is a thing. Now, people are like, \u201cOh, cool, I\u2019ve heard of that!\u201d And sometimes they\u2019ll ask us, \u201cOh, were you onShark Tank?\u201d Because there were a couple of companies making [insect-based] products for peopleonShark Tank\u2014 and we\u2019re like, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not us! But yeah, it\u2019s like that!\u201d\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s really shifted is, during the pandemic, more people adopted pets. And the people who adopted pets had more time to research what they were going to give to their pets \u2013 what kind of food. And one of the other things that\u2019s been happening is pet ownership is starting to shift younger and younger, which is great for us. Millennials and Gen Zare closing in on 50 percent of the pet ownershipin the U.S. \u2014 and they just get it. When we say we\u2019re working with insect protein, they\u2019re like, \u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d And when we talk about the sustainability, they\u2019re like, \u201cYes, that\u2019s important to me.\u201d When we say we\u2019re reducing the carbon pawprint, it just makes sense. They know what we\u2019re talking about.\n\nQ. What\u2019s your vision for where the pet industry could be in 10, 20, or 30 years?\n\nA.It needs to change so much. There needs to be sustainability across the board. I do see some great things that are happening in certain areas. Petco now has this [refill option] for cat litter; you can actually bring your own container and scoop the litter into your own container and take it away, rather than getting another plastic container. I think that\u2019s a great example of innovation in another category within pets. But I\u2019d love to see rethinking of the materials that are used for leashes and collars. I mean, think about going into one of those superstores and how many different types of products there are, and then think about how much plastic there is. We need to get away from these materials that can\u2019t be reused or recycled. And I\u2019d like to see other proteins being used that are sustainable as well \u2014 getting away from the cow and the chicken that is just so problematic.\n\nQ. What about your daughter? Has she shared her thoughts on the company, and how your vision has impacted her?\n\nA.She hasn\u2019t said absolutely that she wants to have kids, but she\u2019s more open to the idea than she was before. I think there\u2019s more hope. She sees what we\u2019re doing, she sees what others are doing. And we\u2019re trying to [approach sustainability] not just from the products that we make, but we\u2019re trying to make sure that everything we do is moving in the right direction. We\u2019re moving our packaging to sustainable packaging. We\u2019re offsetting [our shipping] by planting trees.We planted over 65,000 trees already. Everything that we do, we try to put it through the lens of, is this the best solution? Is this the best answer, when we think about climate change?\n\nRead more from theClimate Future Cookbook:\n\nA message from\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.
