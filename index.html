        <p>AI coding assistants are becoming wildly popular, with the vast majority of respondents in GitHub&#x27;s latest poll saying that they&#x27;ve adopted AI tools in some form. Y Combinator partner Jared Friedman recently claimed that a quarter of YC&#x27;s W25 startup batch have 95% of their codebases generated by AI.</p>

Cloud-based tools likeSlackandGoogle Drivehave helped teams communicate and share resources as easily across the hall as across the country, but just because all the resources you\u2019ll need to get the job done are saved to shared folders or pinned to Slack channels doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re all equally accessible. This week, we\u2019re hearing about OpenAI\u2019s work on a new development that could do something about just that, linking Drive and Slack toChatGPT.\n\nThe company is working on a feature dubbed ChatGPT Connectors, according to a report fromTechCrunch. This would allow the chatbot to tap into shared work resources to address user queries. The system shares relevant data with ChatGPT over an encrypted connection, hopefully satisfying firms that might be a little nervous about letting an AI engine loose in an archive of company secrets, and will respect user permissions, so when you ask ChatGPT something it will only rely upon info in folders and channels you have access to for its response.\n\nParticularly private stuff like Slack DMs won\u2019t be indexed by Connectors, and there are a few gaps in its skill set with shared files, not supporting images in documents, and having only a limited ability to read spreadsheet data.\n\nStill, this sounds like it has the potential to be incredibly useful, and especially so for remote workers. ChatGPT Connector hooked up to Google Drive and Slack could become the stand-in for that employee everyone\u2019s always turning to for answers about policies, or best practices, able to instantly tap into that wealthy of company knowledge. In industries with a lot of turnover, that\u2019s just going to be all the more valuable.\n\nSo far, OpenAI has yet to confirm for ChatGPT Connectors. And while TechCrunch reports that the feature should go into testing soon, we don\u2019t yet have any kind of precise timetable.", "extraction_status": "success"}, {"company": "Stripe", "title": "Stripe finalizes tender sale at a $91.5B valuation, says payment volumes grew to $1.4T in 2024", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/stripe-finalizes-tender-sale-at-a-91-5b-valuation-says-payment-volumes-grew-to-1-4t-in-2024/", "source": "TechCrunch", "body": "Digital payments platform Stripe has yet to lay out plans to go public, but in the meantime the company has thrown past and present employees a line for", "date": "2025-02-27T14:39:00+00:00", "full_content": "Stripe finalizes tender sale at a $91.5B valuation, says payment volumes grew to $1.4T in 2024 | TechCrunch Stripe finalizes tender sale at a $91.5B valuation, says payment volumes grew to $1.4T in 2024 | TechCrunch Image Credits: SOPA Images / Contributor / Getty Images Fintech Stripe finalizes tender sale at a $91.5B valuation, says payment volumes grew to $1.4T in 2024 Ingrid Lunden 6:32 AM PST \u00b7 February 27, 2025 Digital payments platform Stripe has yet to lay out plans to go public, but in the meantime the company has thrown past and present employees a line for some liquidity. The company on Thursday confirmed a tender offer where investors will buy up shares from those employees at a valuation of $91.5 billion. Stripe said it will also repurchase shares as part of the transaction. A spokesperson declined to say who is in the secondary round except to confirm that it is \u201clargely\u201d existing investors. Past backers of the company number at over 150 investors per PitchBook data . They include General Catalyst, GV, Silver Lake, Atomico, Elon Musk, Salesforce and many more. The tender offer is a decent jump on the company\u2019s valuation from its last secondary sale a year ago, which was valued at $70 billion . However, Stripe still fell short of its high-watermark $95 billion valuation back in 2021. That round came at a time when e-commerce itself was booming due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it made Stripe, at the time and only on paper, the most valuable privately-held tech company in the world. The news coincides with Stripe\u2019s annual letter penned by CEO and co-founder Patrick Collison, which noted that payment volume in 2024 grew to $1.4 trillion, up 38% on the year before. It\u2019s a big number for Stripe, but to put it into some context, Visa said that its payment volume for 2024 was $13.2 trillion. The margin that Stripe makes on transactions (which are what make up payment volume) remains thin, and so this business remains one where it still has room to (and needs to) scale. Stripe also added that it is now used by half of the Fortune 100 companies, underscoring how it has catapulted from a startup working with other startups, into a major enterprise player. The tender offer was originally reported to be in the works earlier this month .

Generate Key Takeaways Tapestry\u2019s Coach has filed a suit against the fast-fashion specialist Shein for trademark counterfeiting, federal trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair competition. The 30-page complaint was filed on Thursday in the U.S. District Court in the Central District of California by Tapestry Inc., Coach Services Inc. and Coach IP Holdings against Zoetop Business Co. and Shein U.S. Services. A juried trial is being sought. More from WWD Trump's Tariffs: The Hot-button Topic at AAFA Executive Summit in D.C. Jewelry Designer Pamela Love Sues Alex and Ani Beneficial Owners for Unpaid Consulting Fees and Sales Royalties Chanel and What Goes Around Comes Around Hear Final Judgment for Infringement Case Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The suit alleges that Shein used commerce marks that are \u201cidentical or substantially indistinguishable or confusingly similar to Coach trademarks in connection with the sale, distribution and/or advertising\u201d of the alleged counterfeit products. The allegations include that when one searches for \u201ccoach\u201d on Shein\u2019s e-commerce site, there is \u201cno indication\u201d that any of the products originated from a third-party seller. When a shopper selects \u201cwhat appears to be legitimate \u2018 Coach \u2019 product for purchase, the third-party seller\u2019s information is so small and inconspicuous that the shopper could \u201creasonably believe\u201d that Shein was the seller with title or possession of the product. Attorneys for Tapestry and Coach did not respond immediately Tuesday afternoon to requests for comment, nor did an attorney for Shein. Representatives at both companies also had not returned media requests as of Tuesday afternoon. Designer dupes and fake fashion items are an ongoing issue for major brands. Nearly seven in 10 consumers were deceived into buying counterfeit products online at least once in 2023, according to research by Michigan State University\u2019s College of Communication Arts and Sciences. Less than two years ago, the U.S. Congress passed the Integrity, Notification and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers Act to better inform consumers about third-party sellers and to reduce the number of fake and stolen goods that are sold online. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The complaint features multiple pages with photographs of the alleged counterfeit Coach products including tote bags, handbags, shoes, hats and purses. Tapestry alleges that Shein made, marketed and sold knockoff items that used the Coach name, logos, hardware and signature \u201cC\u201d designs. The products highlighted in the legal complaint were items that were sold through Shein\u2019s marketplace platform, which allows third-party users to post product listings. Describing the \u201cworld of Chinese marketplaces\u201d as a bit like the wild west, Neil Saunders, managing director for retail at GlobalData, said \u201cit is hardly surprising that Tapestry wants to use the law as a taming influence. The complaint is legitimate inasmuch as Coach dupes are sold on Shein, and it\u2019s almost impossible for the consumer to understand exactly what they\u2019re buying. That\u2019s detrimental to the Coach brand.\u201d While it remains to be seen how the courts \u201cinterpret the technicalities of the law as the goods are sold by third parties rather than directly by Shein,\u201d Saunders said, \u201cCoach is trying to hold Shein fully liable. If they win, it will be a big victory for brands and will force Shein to take tough action on dupes and counterfeits.\u201d Like its archrival in the fast-fashion sector Temu, Shein is facing multiple suits that have been brought forward by established brands and little-known artists for trademark infringement and counterfeit goods. The Tapestry-Shein legal action comes at a time when President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is trying to stop ultra-cheap imports from entering the U.S. without tariffs.

Home Stocks Alphabet -stock News for Alphabet Palantir Partners with Databricks in a Move That Shakes the AI Industry Palantir Partners with Databricks in a Move That Shakes the AI Industry TipRanks Mar. 18, 2025, 09:29 AM Overall, Palantir (PLTR) has had a solid start to 2025. Its growth numbers look impressive, and its AI platform is gaining traction across industries. Yet not everyone is convinced. Some investors still hesitate due to the stock\u2019s high price, its history of sharp swings, insiders\u2019 selling shares , and the Pentagon declaring Budget cuts that will impact Palantir\u2019s bottom line, as more than half of its revenue stems from defense contracts.

Despite its steady rise \u2013 its stock is up 15% year-to-date \u2013 Palantir has yet to fully overcome analysts\u2019 doubts about its ability to maintain this pace. Nevertheless, one analyst from William Blair thinks Palantir\u2019s recent move to partner with its foe, Databricks, is a game-changer. Palantir and Databricks Join Hands Last week, the company made a move that could change the game. Palantir partnered with Databricks, another big name in AI-driven data analytics. The two companies have often been seen as rivals, but now they\u2019re working together to make their platforms more compatible. This isn\u2019t a full merger of their tools, and they won\u2019t be selling a joint product. Instead, they\u2019re making it easier for businesses to use both systems side by side. Louie DiPalma, an analyst at William Blair, weighed in on the move, noting that while Palantir and Databricks compete in some areas, they rarely go head-to-head for contracts. The market, he said, is big enough for both. More importantly, the partnership makes sense for customers. \u201cSince there are now many joint users, it makes sense for both of their data platforms to work nicely with each other,\u201d he explained. Beyond commercial clients, the partnership could also be key in the government sector. The U.S. government recently issued an order requiring agencies to adopt better tracking systems for payments. Palantir, with its reputation for handling high-security data, stands to benefit. Working with Databricks strengthens its position as a go-to choice for agencies needing powerful AI tools. For Palantir, this partnership could be a turning point. It expands its reach, enhances its platform, and makes it more competitive against tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL) (GOOG) . However, the big question remains: will this be enough to finally convince skeptical investors that Palantir\u2019s rise is just getting started? Is PLTR a Buy, Hold, or a Sell? Turning to Wall Street, Palantir is considered a Hold. The average price target for PLTR stock is $94.27 , implying a 7.92% upside potential.

Unstructured data, such as Word files, images, or videos, had no place in traditional data analytics before generative AI, noted Frankle. But now, it's a goldmine.\n\n\"Imagine tons and tons of unstructured documents, which are really tricky to analyze in a pre-generative AI or pre-LLM world, and suddenly you can extract meaningful features from them,\" he said. \"Data that was useless in an analytics world is now incredibly valuable here.\"\n\nAlso:Will synthetic data derail generative AI's momentum or be the breakthrough we need?\n\nWhile many people fixate on generative AI taking over actual programming code, a much simpler use would be to simply analyze a company's computer code.\n\n\"All the documentation for all of the code at your company\" was \"not really that useful as a data source in 2015, but, in 2025, incredibly valuable [...] just answering questions about your code for developers.\"\n\nSimilarly, \"You can imagine every single chat log from a customer service application with real humans, doing high-level analytics on that. What is the average number of interactions in a conversation? What is the average time to resolve an issue? Things that would not have been possible ten years ago.\"\n\nThe role of data is central in developing generative AI apps, said Frankle. Frankle came to Databricks whenit bought the machine learning startuphe was working for, MosaicML, in 2023. MosaicML focuses on optimizing the infrastructure for running AI, whereas Databricks is one of the leading purveyors of data lakes and technology to move and shape data.\n\nAlso:AI agents aren't just assistants: How they're changing the future of work today\n\n\"The whole thesis for the acquisition was that we had one piece, Databricks had a lot of other pieces, and it made much more sense together,\" said Frankle.\n\n\"You're trying to deploy an AI customer service bot. What data is that customer service bot working off of?\" Frankle explained. \"It's working off of customer information, it's working off your documentation, it's working off your SQL databases. That's all on Databricks.\"\n\nHaving the data together in Databricks is the beginning of creating the kinds of new analytics Frankle cites. WhileLLMscan make use of a pile of unstructured data, it doesn't hurt to get a company's data into some kind of structure beforehand.\n\n\"If you did the work in advance to use an LLM to pre-process that data into some kind of structured form, like SQL or JSON, you're asking for less work on the part of the AI -- you should always try to make things as easy as possible for the AI because these systems are definitely not infallible.\"\n\nAlso:8 out of 10 college students and administrators welcome AI agents\n\nAn important preparatory step is putting the data into what are called \"embeddings.\"\n\nAn \"embedding model\" is an AI model that is used to turn characters, words, or sentences into a vector -- a group of numbers -- that capture some of the semantic content of those characters, words, or sentences.\n\nYou can think of embeddings as numeric scores representing the relatedness of terms, such as \"apple\" to \"fruit,\" or \"baby\" to \"human.\"\n\nSimple language models, even relatively small ones, such as Google's BERT from 2018, can be used to make embeddings. \"You don't need huge models to get great embeddings,\" said Frankle.\n\nA lot of embedding models have been developed in the open-source community, noted Frankle, by adapting Meta Platforms' Llama model via the process known as fine-tuning.\n\nHowever, \"You might need to train a custom embedding model,\" given that existing ones are \"built on web data,\" making them very general.\n\nIn specific domains, such as healthcare, for example, a custom embedding model can find relationships between words and phrases better than a generic embedding model.\n\n\"We're finding that customizing embedding models can lead to disproportionately good retrieval improvement,\" said Frankle. \"We think there's still a lot of juice to squeeze out of just making them [embedding models] more specific to a domain.\"\n\nA well-developed embedding model is exceptionally important because \"they will make the heavy lifting that's done [by the large language model] a lot easier,\" he said.\n\nAlso:Is your business AI-ready? 5 ways to avoid falling behind\n\nMultiple embedding models can also be chained together, said Frankle. That can allow an AI model used in, for example, document search, to narrow down from a large group of a hundred documents to just a handful that answer a query.\n\nIn addition to tuning an embedding model, how data is fed into the embedding is its own area of excellence. \"When you provide these documents to an embedding model, you usually don't want to provide the whole document all at once,\" he said.\n\n\"You often want to chunk it into pieces,\" and how to do so optimally is also a matter of experimenting and trying approaches.\n\nFrankle added that Databricks is \"doing research on all of these topics because, in a lot of cases, we don't think the state of the art is good enough,\" including embeddings.\n\nWhile a lot can be \"plug and play\" via Databricks, says Frankle, \"the trickiest part is there's still a lot of experimentation. There are a lot of knobs that need to be turned. Should you fine-tune, or should you not fine-tune? How many documents should you try to retrieve and put in the context? What is your chunk size?\"\n\nBeyond the techniques, knowing what apps to build is itself a journey and something of a fishing expedition.\n\n\"I think the hardest part in AI is having confidence that this will work,\" said Frankle. \"If you came to me and said, 'Here's a problem in the healthcare space, here are the documents I have, do you think AI can do this?' my answer would be, 'Let's find out.'\"\n\nFrom what Frankle is seeing with customers, \"Applications that are getting into practice right now tend to look for things that are a little more open-ended,\" he said -- meaning what the AI model produces can be fuzzy, not necessarily specific. \"AI is great at producing an answer, not always great at producingtheanswer,\" he observed.\n\nAlso:Here's why you should ignore 99% of AI tools - and which four I use every day\n\n\"With AI, you can do fuzzy things, you can do document understanding in ways that I could never write a Python program for,\" Frankle explained.\n\n\"I also look for applications where it's relatively expensive to come to an answer but relatively cheap to check the answer.\" An example is the automatic generation of textual notes for a doctor from recordings of his patient exams. \"A draft set of patient notes can be generated, they [the doctor or doctor's assistant] can check it, tweak a couple of things, and call it a day.\" That's a useful way to eliminate tedium, he said.\n\nConversely, \"Applications where you need the right answer, and they're hard to check\" may be something to avoid for now. He gave the example of drafting a legal document. \"If the AI misses one thing, the human now needs to go and review the whole document to make sure they didn't miss anything else. So, what was the point of using the AI?\" Frankle observed.\n\nOn the other hand, there is lots of potential for AI to do things such as take over grunt work for lawyers and paralegals and, as a result, broaden the access people have to lawyers.\n\nAlso:Want to win in the age of AI? You can either build it or build your business with it\n\n\"Suppose that AI could automate some of the most boring legal tasks that exist?\" offered Frankle, whose parents are lawyers. \"If you wanted an AI to help you do legal research, and help you ideate about how to solve a problem, or help you find relevant materials -- phenomenal!\"\n\n\"We're still in very early days\" of generative AI, \"and so, kind of, we're benefiting from the strengths, but we're still learning how to mitigate the weaknesses.\"\n\nIn the midst of uncertainty, Frankle is impressed with how customers have quickly traversed the learning curve. \"Two or three years ago, there was a lot of explaining to customers what generative AI was,\" he noted. \"Now, when I talk to customers, they're using vector databases.\"\n\n\"These folks have a great intuition for where these things are succeeding and where they aren't,\" he said of Databricks customers.\n\nGiven that no company has an unlimited budget, Frankle advised starting with an initial prototype, so that investment only proceeds to the extent that it's clear an AI app will provide value.\n\nAlso:Even premium AI tools distort the news and fabricate links - these are the worst\n\n\"It should be something you can throw together in a day usingGPT-4, and a handful of documents you already have,\" he offered. The developer can enlist \"a couple random people from around the company who can tell you you're on the right track here or not.\"\n\nFor managers, Frankle advises making exploration of generative AI a part of the job on a regular basis.\n\n\"People are motivated,\" such as data scientists, he noted. \"It's even less about the money and more about just giving them the time and saying, as part of your job responsibilities, take a couple weeks, do a two-day hackathon, and just go see what you can do. That's really exciting for people.\"\n\nThe motto in enterprise generative AI might be, from tiny acorns grow mighty oaks.\n\nAs Frankle put it, \"The person who happens to have that GPU in their basement, and is playing with Llama, actually is very sophisticated, and could be the generative AI expert of tomorrow.\"", "extraction_status": "success"}, {"company": "Anthropic", "title": "Anthropic-backed AI-powered code review platform Graphite raises cash", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/anthropic-backed-ai-powered-code-review-platform-graphite-raises-cash/ar-AA1Baywb", "source": "TechCrunch", "body": "AI coding assistants are becoming wildly popular, with the vast majority of respondents in GitHub's latest poll saying that they've adopted AI tools in some form.

Revolut currently supports fewer currencies than Wise, although more currencies are coming.\n\nLike Revolut, Chime offers mobile-first banking and a card that works for payments worldwide. However, Chime accounts can only be opened by U.S. customers with a valid Social Security number, while Revolut offers services to customers across the globe.\n\nChime is mostly fee-free, except for withdrawals made from out-of-network ATMs. Revolut, on the other hand, charges users for many advanced services, including withdrawals above monthly limits.\n\nChime also offers faster access to your paychecks, up to two days early, and has a much better Better Business Bureau Rating and more positive online customer reviews than Revolut.\n\nSchwab Bank Investor checking offers investing and banking services, just as Revolut does\u2014although you must be a Schwab investment customer to gain access to the checking account.\n\nSchwab offers its Investor Checking customers unlimited ATM fee rebates worldwide and no foreign transaction fees. Like Revolut, it has a full-featured mobile app to manage many banking services.\n\nSchwab does not have the focus on international customers and travel perks Revolut does. But it provides more traditional banking services\u2014including access to loans and other financial products\u2014and has local branches you can visit for customer support.\n\nForbes Advisor scores banks and credit unions on a number of factors, including the following:\n\nWe give separate ratings to the individual products offered by each financial institution, such as checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and CDs. We assign banks a rating from one and five stars, with one star being the lowest rating and five stars being the highest.\n\nTo learn about our rating system and review methodology, check out our guide onhow Forbes Advisor reviews banks.\n\nRevolut does not offer all of the features you\u2019d expect from a standard bank, such as access to certificates of deposit. Customers will have to pay fees if they want more advanced features, and there is no in-person or phone customer support in the United States.\n\nRevolut is a legitimate business that has been operating since 2015. It has more than 50 million customers across over 140 countries and regions. Users have given the Revolut app stellar ratings, but the business lacks Better Business Bureau accreditation and reviews there are mixed. But Revolut\u2019s partner bank in the U.S. is FDIC-insured, so your deposited funds are protected up to the $250,000 FDIC limit.\n\nYes, Revolut works in the United States. It debuted its financial services for Americans in March 2020 and reported in October 2023 that it had 840,000 customers in the U.S.", "extraction_status": "success"}, {"company": "Canva", "title": "How to Use Canva AI to Create Business Cards", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/general/general/how-to-use-canva-ai-to-create-business-cards/ar-AA1B595w", "source": "CNET", "body": "I decided to use Canva's Magic Design, Magic Media, Magic Write and Canva Print for my business card project.
