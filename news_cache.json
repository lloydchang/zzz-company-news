Billionaire and tech titan Elon Musk shared his congratulations to SpaceX and NASA following the rescue of two astronauts stranded at the International Space Station for roughly the past nine months. \"Thanks to the excellent work of the SpaceX team working with NASA, the astronauts are now safely home. And so congratulations to the SpaceX NASA teams on excellent work,\" Musk said during an exclusive interview on \"Hannity\" Tuesday. The SpaceX founder and face of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) also offered a \"huge note of appreciation\" to President Donald Trump \"for prioritizing and expediting the return.\" SPACEX DRAGON CAPSULE STICKS SPLASHDOWN LANDING AS NASA ASTRONAUTS RETURN HOME AFTER MONTHS STUCK IN SPACE Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams had been on the International Space Station since June 2024. Their mission was only scheduled to last one week after the launch of Boeing's first astronaut flight. However, after the spacecraft encountered technical issues, and NASA determined it unsafe for it to arrive back to Earth with the astronauts on board, Wilmore and Williams remained stuck at the International Space Station for months. Wilmore, Williams, Crew-9 Commander Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov made their return to Earth on Tuesday, with a splashdown off the coast of Florida just before 6 p.m. ET. Video Wilmore and Williams' return became a political issue for the Trump administration, with Musk previously telling Fox News host Sean Hannity on Feb. 18 that former President Joe Biden left the astronauts in space for \"political reasons.\" Shortly after taking office, Trump tasked Musk with bringing home the two astronauts, who he said had been \"abandoned\" by the Biden administration. Video STRANDED ASTRONAUT SAYS HE BELIEVES MUSK'S CLAIMS THAT BIDEN REFUSED TO CONDUCT RESCUE MISSION Trump also blasted Biden for not acting sooner. \"I have just asked Elon Musk and @SpaceX to ‘go get’ the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration. They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!\" posted Trump at the time . Video In a post-landing news conference with SpaceX and NASA officials on Tuesday, Deputy Associate Administrator, NASA Space Operations Mission Directorate Joel Montalbano was asked about Trump and Musk's claims that the Biden administration didn't want to bring the Starliner crew back for political reasons. Video \"Yeah, so I wasn't involved in any conversations with the previous administration,\" Montalbano said. \"It was clear we had a request from the current administration, and the results you saw are what we saw today with the landing of Crew-9.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Hannity pressed Musk on the politics behind the astronauts' delayed return, and Musk set the record straight on his communications with the previous Biden administration. \"We definitely offered to return the astronauts earlier. There's no question about that,\" Musk said. \"The astronauts were only supposed to be there for eight days, and they've been there for almost ten months. So, obviously, that doesn't make any sense. SpaceX could have brought the astronauts back after a few months at most, and we made that offer to the Biden administration. It was rejected for political reasons, and that's just a fact.\" Fox News' Jonathan Serrie, Landon Mion, Diana Stancy, Christina Shaw and Reuters contributed to this report.

    "full_content": "OpenAI is pushing for Donald Trump to weaken copyright protections in the US. Paul McCartney is fighting back. March 19, 2025 By Tim Ingham Pic credits: Shutterstock OpenAI founder Sam Altman finds himself up against Sir Paul McCartney in the battle to convince US lawmakers over copyright laws and artificial intelligence The maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI, has called for fundamental changes to US copyright law that would allow AI companies to use copyrighted works without permission or compensation to rightsholders. Continue to article... That’s according to a fresh policy submission to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The document does not make happy reading for copyright holders, which explains why music stars like Sir Paul McCartney, Paul Simon, and Bette Midler have joined hundreds of Hollywood celebrities in signing a letter pushing back against the proposals. The submission, filed by OpenAI on March 13 ( read it in full here ), is part of the tech company’s response to the Trump administration’s request for information on developing a national AI Action Plan . Both OpenAI and Google submitted detailed policy frameworks that could significantly impact music rightsholders and other content creators. These submissions represent high-stakes policy positioning as the Trump administration develops its AI Action Plan, which could fundamentally shape how creative works are protected â or not protected â in the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem. OpenAI Calls for Unrestricted AI Training Access In its March 13 submission, OpenAI heavily focuses on the concept of “fair use” â i.e. platforms being able to use copyright in certain circumstances without punishment. The firm explicitly argues that applying the ‘fair use’ doctrine to AI in the United States is “not only a matter of American competitiveness â it’s a matter of national security” ,Â while warning that without it having free access to copyrighted materials, “the race for AI is effectively over” . In OpenAI’s eyes, China will win that race if the US doesn’t loosen its copyright laws. “If [China’s] developers have unfettered access to data and American companies are left without fair use access , the race for AI is effectively over. America loses , as does the success of democratic AI.” OpenAI submission The relevant quote from the OpenAI submission reads: “Applying the fair use doctrine to AI is not only a matter of American competitiveness â it’s a matter of national security . The rapid advances seen with the PRC [People’s Republic Of China]’s DeepSeek , among other recent developments, show that America’s lead on frontier AI is far from guaranteed.” OpenAI adds: “Given concerted state support for critical industries and infrastructure projects, there’s little doubt that the PRC’s AI developers will enjoy unfettered access to data â including copyrighted data â that will improve their models. “If the PRC’s developers have unfettered access to data and American companies are left without fair use access , the race for AI is effectively over. America loses , as does the success of democratic AI.” OpenAI’s submission further states: “American copyright law, including the longstanding fair use doctrine, protects the transformative uses of existing works, ensuring that innovators have a balanced and predictable framework for experimentation and entrepreneurship.” Did OpenAI just give a gift to music’s lobbyists? Passages in Â OpenAI’s Â submission could be interpreted as acknowledging thatÂ current US copyright law restricts the company’s desired activities, though theÂ language is somewhat ambiguous. One notable section is where OpenAI states: “If the PRC’s developers have unfettered access to data and American companies are left without fair use access, the race for AI is effectively over.” The wording of the phrase “if American companies are left without fair use access” implies that AI companies in the US might need specific new ‘fair use’ protections drafted to continue using copyrighted materials. In turn, that could be interpreted as recognition that without such clear protections â i.e. under today’s laws â their activities might be legally questionable. Google Aligns with OpenAI on Copyright Stance Google’s submission ( read it in full here ) echoes similar sentiments, though with slightly less alarmist language. The search giant argues that “balanced copyright rules, such as fair use and text-and-data mining exceptions , have been critical to enabling AI systems to learn from prior knowledge and publicly available data, unlocking scientific and social advances.” âWe support Americaâs existing fair use framework, and weâre confident that current copyright law enables AI innovation.â Google spokesperson The company adds that these exceptions “allow for the use of copyrighted, publicly available material for AI training without significantly impacting rightsholders and avoid often highly unpredictable, imbalanced, and lengthy negotiations with data holders during model development or scientific experimentation.” It warns that copyright laws could, under certain interpretations, “impede appropriate access to data necessary for training leading models”. Subsequent to the submission being filed, a Google spokesperson said in a statement, âWe support Americaâs existing fair use framework, and weâre confident that current copyright law enables AI innovation.â The McCartney response Stars from the world of film, TV, and music have signed a letter in response to the OpenAI and Google proposals, including Cate Blanchett, Cynthia Erivo, Paul McCartney, Paul Simon, Ron Howard, Taika Waititi, Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, Mark Ruffalo, Guillermo del Toro , and Ava Duvernay. In their letter to the US government this week, the copyright-makers state, “We firmly believe that Americaâs global AI leadership must not come at the expense of our essential creative industries.” They add that the US arts and entertainment industry provides more than 2.3 million jobsÂ and “ provides the foundation forÂ American democratic influence and soft power abroad .” The letter continues: â[AI] companies are asking to undermine this economic and cultural strength by weakening copyright protections for the films, television series, artworks, writing, music, and voices used to train AI models at the core of multi-billion dollar corporate valuations.â You can read the letter â signed by 400 famous creators â in full below: Hello Friends & Strangers. As you may be aware there has recently been a recommendation by OpenAI & Google to the current US Administration that is gaining alarming traction to remove all legal protections & existing guardrails surrounding copyright law protections for the training of Artificial Intelligence. This rewriting of established law in favor of so-called âFair Useâ was in need of an initial response by 11:59 PM ET Saturday, so we have submitted an initial letter with the signatories we had at that time. We are now continuing to accept signatures for an amendment to our initial statement. Please feel free to forward this to anyone you think may be invested in the ethical maintenance of their intellectual property. You can add your name and whatever guilds or unions or description of self you feel appropriate, but please do not edit the letter itself. Thank you so much for kicking this out wide on a Saturday Night! Hollywoodâs Response to the Administrationâs Artificial Intelligence Action Plan and necessity that copyright law be upheld. We, the members of Americaâs entertainment industry â representing an intersection of cinematographers, directors, producers, actors, writers, studios, production companies, musicians, composers, costume, sound & production designers, editors, gaffers, union and Academy Members, and other industrious, creative content professionals â submit this unified statement in response to the Administrationâs request for input on the AI Action Plan. We firmly believe that Americaâs global AI leadership must not come at the expense of our essential creative industries. Americaâs arts and entertainment industry supports over 2.3M American jobs with over $229Bn in wages annually, while providing the foundation for American democratic influence and soft power abroad. But AI companies are asking to undermine this economic and cultural strength by weakening copyright protections for the films, television series, artworks, writing, music, and voices used to train AI models at the core of multi-billion dollar corporate valuations. Make no mistake: this issue goes well beyond the entertainment industry, as the right to train AI on all copyright-protected content impacts all of Americaâs knowledge industries. When tech and AI companies demand unfettered access to all data and information, theyâre not just threatening movies, books, and music, but the work of all writers, publishers, photographers, scientists, architects, engineers, designers, doctors, software developers and all other professionals who work with computers and generate intellectual property. These professions are the core of how we discover, learn, and share knowledge as a society and as a nation. This issue is not just about AI leadership or about economics and individual rights, but about Americaâs continued leadership in creating and owning valuable intellectual property in every field. It is clear that Google (valued at $2Tn) and OpenAI (valued at over $157Bn) are arguing for a special government exemption so they can freely exploit Americaâs creative and knowledge industries, despite their substantial revenues and available funds. There is no reason to weaken or eliminate the copyright protections that have helped America flourish. Not when AI companies can use our copyrighted material by simply doing what the law requires: negotiating appropriate licenses with copyright holders â just as every other industry does. Access to Americaâs creative catalog of films, writing, video content, and music is not a matter of national security. They do not require a government-mandated exemption from existing U.S. copyright law. America didnât become a global cultural powerhouse by accident. Our success stems directly from our fundamental respect for IP and copyright that rewards creative risk-taking by talented and hardworking Americans from every state and territory. For nearly 250 years, U.S. copyright law has balanced creatorâs rights with the needs of the public, creating the worldâs most vibrant creative economy. We recommend that the American AI Action Plan uphold existing copyright frameworks to maintain the strength of Americaâs creative and knowledge industries, as well as American cultural influence abroad.

The company on Thursday confirmed a tender offer where investors will buy up shares from those employees at a valuation of $91.5 billion. Stripe said it will also repurchase shares as part of the transaction. A spokesperson declined to say who is in the secondary round except to confirm that it is “largely” existing investors. Past backers of the company number at over 150 investors per PitchBook data . They include General Catalyst, GV, Silver Lake, Atomico, Elon Musk, Salesforce and many more. The tender offer is a decent jump on the company’s valuation from its last secondary sale a year ago, which was valued at $70 billion . However, Stripe still fell short of its high-watermark $95 billion valuation back in 2021. That round came at a time when e-commerce itself was booming due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it made Stripe, at the time and only on paper, the most valuable privately-held tech company in the world. The news coincides with Stripe’s annual letter penned by CEO and co-founder Patrick Collison, which noted that payment volume in 2024 grew to $1.4 trillion, up 38% on the year before. It’s a big number for Stripe, but to put it into some context, Visa said that its payment volume for 2024 was $13.2 trillion. The margin that Stripe makes on transactions (which are what make up payment volume) remains thin, and so this business remains one where it still has room to (and needs to) scale. Stripe also added that it is now used by half of the Fortune 100 companies, underscoring how it has catapulted from a startup working with other startups, into a major enterprise player. The tender offer was originally reported to be in the works earlier this month .

Generate Key Takeaways Tapestry’s Coach has filed a suit against the fast-fashion specialist Shein for trademark counterfeiting, federal trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair competition. The 30-page complaint was filed on Thursday in the U.S. District Court in the Central District of California by Tapestry Inc., Coach Services Inc. and Coach IP Holdings against Zoetop Business Co. and Shein U.S. Services. A juried trial is being sought. More from WWD Trump's Tariffs: The Hot-button Topic at AAFA Executive Summit in D.C. Jewelry Designer Pamela Love Sues Alex and Ani Beneficial Owners for Unpaid Consulting Fees and Sales Royalties Chanel and What Goes Around Comes Around Hear Final Judgment for Infringement Case Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The suit alleges that Shein used commerce marks that are “identical or substantially indistinguishable or confusingly similar to Coach trademarks in connection with the sale, distribution and/or advertising” of the alleged counterfeit products. The allegations include that when one searches for “coach” on Shein’s e-commerce site, there is “no indication” that any of the products originated from a third-party seller. When a shopper selects “what appears to be legitimate ‘ Coach ’ product for purchase, the third-party seller’s information is so small and inconspicuous that the shopper could “reasonably believe” that Shein was the seller with title or possession of the product. Attorneys for Tapestry and Coach did not respond immediately Tuesday afternoon to requests for comment, nor did an attorney for Shein. Representatives at both companies also had not returned media requests as of Tuesday afternoon. Designer dupes and fake fashion items are an ongoing issue for major brands. Nearly seven in 10 consumers were deceived into buying counterfeit products online at least once in 2023, according to research by Michigan State University’s College of Communication Arts and Sciences. Less than two years ago, the U.S. Congress passed the Integrity, Notification and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers Act to better inform consumers about third-party sellers and to reduce the number of fake and stolen goods that are sold online. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The complaint features multiple pages with photographs of the alleged counterfeit Coach products including tote bags, handbags, shoes, hats and purses. Tapestry alleges that Shein made, marketed and sold knockoff items that used the Coach name, logos, hardware and signature “C” designs. The products highlighted in the legal complaint were items that were sold through Shein’s marketplace platform, which allows third-party users to post product listings. Describing the “world of Chinese marketplaces” as a bit like the wild west, Neil Saunders, managing director for retail at GlobalData, said “it is hardly surprising that Tapestry wants to use the law as a taming influence. The complaint is legitimate inasmuch as Coach dupes are sold on Shein, and it’s almost impossible for the consumer to understand exactly what they’re buying. That’s detrimental to the Coach brand.” While it remains to be seen how the courts “interpret the technicalities of the law as the goods are sold by third parties rather than directly by Shein,” Saunders said, “Coach is trying to hold Shein fully liable. If they win, it will be a big victory for brands and will force Shein to take tough action on dupes and counterfeits.” Like its archrival in the fast-fashion sector Temu, Shein is facing multiple suits that have been brought forward by established brands and little-known artists for trademark infringement and counterfeit goods. The Tapestry-Shein legal action comes at a time when President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to stop ultra-cheap imports from entering the U.S. without tariffs.

Its growth numbers look impressive, and its AI platform is gaining traction across industries. Yet not everyone is convinced.

Despite its steady rise – its stock is up 15% year-to-date – Palantir has yet to fully overcome analysts’ doubts about its ability to maintain this pace. Nevertheless, one analyst from William Blair thinks Palantir’s recent move to partner with its foe, Databricks, is a game-changer. Palantir and Databricks Join Hands Last week, the company made a move that could change the game. Palantir partnered with Databricks, another big name in AI-driven data analytics. The two companies have often been seen as rivals, but now they’re working together to make their platforms more compatible. This isn’t a full merger of their tools, and they won’t be selling a joint product. Instead, they’re making it easier for businesses to use both systems side by side. Louie DiPalma, an analyst at William Blair, weighed in on the move, noting that while Palantir and Databricks compete in some areas, they rarely go head-to-head for contracts. The market, he said, is big enough for both. More importantly, the partnership makes sense for customers. “Since there are now many joint users, it makes sense for both of their data platforms to work nicely with each other,” he explained. Beyond commercial clients, the partnership could also be key in the government sector. The U.S. government recently issued an order requiring agencies to adopt better tracking systems for payments. Palantir, with its reputation for handling high-security data, stands to benefit. Working with Databricks strengthens its position as a go-to choice for agencies needing powerful AI tools. For Palantir, this partnership could be a turning point. It expands its reach, enhances its platform, and makes it more competitive against tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL) (GOOG) .
