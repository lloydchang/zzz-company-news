Billionaire and tech titan Elon Musk shared his congratulations to SpaceX and NASA following the rescue of two astronauts stranded at the International Space Station for roughly the past nine months. \"Thanks to the excellent work of the SpaceX team working with NASA, the astronauts are now safely home. And so congratulations to the SpaceX NASA teams on excellent work,\" Musk said during an exclusive interview on \"Hannity\" Tuesday. The SpaceX founder and face of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) also offered a \"huge note of appreciation\" to President Donald Trump \"for prioritizing and expediting the return.\" SPACEX DRAGON CAPSULE STICKS SPLASHDOWN LANDING AS NASA ASTRONAUTS RETURN HOME AFTER MONTHS STUCK IN SPACE Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams had been on the International Space Station since June 2024. Their mission was only scheduled to last one week after the launch of Boeing's first astronaut flight. However, after the spacecraft encountered technical issues, and NASA determined it unsafe for it to arrive back to Earth with the astronauts on board, Wilmore and Williams remained stuck at the International Space Station for months. Wilmore, Williams, Crew-9 Commander Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov made their return to Earth on Tuesday, with a splashdown off the coast of Florida just before 6 p.m. ET. Video Wilmore and Williams' return became a political issue for the Trump administration, with Musk previously telling Fox News host Sean Hannity on Feb. 18 that former President Joe Biden left the astronauts in space for \"political reasons.\" Shortly after taking office, Trump tasked Musk with bringing home the two astronauts, who he said had been \"abandoned\" by the Biden administration. Video STRANDED ASTRONAUT SAYS HE BELIEVES MUSK'S CLAIMS THAT BIDEN REFUSED TO CONDUCT RESCUE MISSION Trump also blasted Biden for not acting sooner. \"I have just asked Elon Musk and @SpaceX to ‘go get’ the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration. They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!\" posted Trump at the time . Video In a post-landing news conference with SpaceX and NASA officials on Tuesday, Deputy Associate Administrator, NASA Space Operations Mission Directorate Joel Montalbano was asked about Trump and Musk's claims that the Biden administration didn't want to bring the Starliner crew back for political reasons. Video \"Yeah, so I wasn't involved in any conversations with the previous administration,\" Montalbano said. \"It was clear we had a request from the current administration, and the results you saw are what we saw today with the landing of Crew-9.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Hannity pressed Musk on the politics behind the astronauts' delayed return, and Musk set the record straight on his communications with the previous Biden administration. \"We definitely offered to return the astronauts earlier. There's no question about that,\" Musk said. \"The astronauts were only supposed to be there for eight days, and they've been there for almost ten months. So, obviously, that doesn't make any sense. SpaceX could have brought the astronauts back after a few months at most, and we made that offer to the Biden administration. It was rejected for political reasons, and that's just a fact.\" Fox News' Jonathan Serrie, Landon Mion, Diana Stancy, Christina Shaw and Reuters contributed to this report.

    "full_content": "OpenAI is pushing for Donald Trump to weaken copyright protections in the US. Paul McCartney is fighting back. March 19, 2025 By Tim Ingham Pic credits: Shutterstock OpenAI founder Sam Altman finds himself up against Sir Paul McCartney in the battle to convince US lawmakers over copyright laws and artificial intelligence The maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI, has called for fundamental changes to US copyright law that would allow AI companies to use copyrighted works without permission or compensation to rightsholders. Continue to article... That’s according to a fresh policy submission to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The document does not make happy reading for copyright holders, which explains why music stars like Sir Paul McCartney, Paul Simon, and Bette Midler have joined hundreds of Hollywood celebrities in signing a letter pushing back against the proposals. The submission, filed by OpenAI on March 13 ( read it in full here ), is part of the tech company’s response to the Trump administration’s request for information on developing a national AI Action Plan . Both OpenAI and Google submitted detailed policy frameworks that could significantly impact music rightsholders and other content creators. These submissions represent high-stakes policy positioning as the Trump administration develops its AI Action Plan, which could fundamentally shape how creative works are protected â or not protected â in the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem. OpenAI Calls for Unrestricted AI Training Access In its March 13 submission, OpenAI heavily focuses on the concept of “fair use” â i.e. platforms being able to use copyright in certain circumstances without punishment. The firm explicitly argues that applying the ‘fair use’ doctrine to AI in the United States is “not only a matter of American competitiveness â it’s a matter of national security” ,Â while warning that without it having free access to copyrighted materials, “the race for AI is effectively over” . In OpenAI’s eyes, China will win that race if the US doesn’t loosen its copyright laws. “If [China’s] developers have unfettered access to data and American companies are left without fair use access , the race for AI is effectively over. America loses , as does the success of democratic AI.” OpenAI submission The relevant quote from the OpenAI submission reads: “Applying the fair use doctrine to AI is not only a matter of American competitiveness â it’s a matter of national security . The rapid advances seen with the PRC [People’s Republic Of China]’s DeepSeek , among other recent developments, show that America’s lead on frontier AI is far from guaranteed.” OpenAI adds: “Given concerted state support for critical industries and infrastructure projects, there’s little doubt that the PRC’s AI developers will enjoy unfettered access to data â including copyrighted data â that will improve their models. “If the PRC’s developers have unfettered access to data and American companies are left without fair use access , the race for AI is effectively over. America loses , as does the success of democratic AI.” OpenAI’s submission further states: “American copyright law, including the longstanding fair use doctrine, protects the transformative uses of existing works, ensuring that innovators have a balanced and predictable framework for experimentation and entrepreneurship.” Did OpenAI just give a gift to music’s lobbyists? Passages in Â OpenAI’s Â submission could be interpreted as acknowledging thatÂ current US copyright law restricts the company’s desired activities, though theÂ language is somewhat ambiguous. One notable section is where OpenAI states: “If the PRC’s developers have unfettered access to data and American companies are left without fair use access, the race for AI is effectively over.” The wording of the phrase “if American companies are left without fair use access” implies that AI companies in the US might need specific new ‘fair use’ protections drafted to continue using copyrighted materials. In turn, that could be interpreted as recognition that without such clear protections â i.e. under today’s laws â their activities might be legally questionable. Google Aligns with OpenAI on Copyright Stance Google’s submission ( read it in full here ) echoes similar sentiments, though with slightly less alarmist language. The search giant argues that “balanced copyright rules, such as fair use and text-and-data mining exceptions , have been critical to enabling AI systems to learn from prior knowledge and publicly available data, unlocking scientific and social advances.” âWe support Americaâs existing fair use framework, and weâre confident that current copyright law enables AI innovation.â Google spokesperson The company adds that these exceptions “allow for the use of copyrighted, publicly available material for AI training without significantly impacting rightsholders and avoid often highly unpredictable, imbalanced, and lengthy negotiations with data holders during model development or scientific experimentation.” It warns that copyright laws could, under certain interpretations, “impede appropriate access to data necessary for training leading models”. Subsequent to the submission being filed, a Google spokesperson said in a statement, âWe support Americaâs existing fair use framework, and weâre confident that current copyright law enables AI innovation.â The McCartney response Stars from the world of film, TV, and music have signed a letter in response to the OpenAI and Google proposals, including Cate Blanchett, Cynthia Erivo, Paul McCartney, Paul Simon, Ron Howard, Taika Waititi, Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, Mark Ruffalo, Guillermo del Toro , and Ava Duvernay. In their letter to the US government this week, the copyright-makers state, “We firmly believe that Americaâs global AI leadership must not come at the expense of our essential creative industries.” They add that the US arts and entertainment industry provides more than 2.3 million jobsÂ and “ provides the foundation forÂ American democratic influence and soft power abroad .” The letter continues: â[AI] companies are asking to undermine this economic and cultural strength by weakening copyright protections for the films, television series, artworks, writing, music, and voices used to train AI models at the core of multi-billion dollar corporate valuations.â You can read the letter â signed by 400 famous creators â in full below: Hello Friends & Strangers. As you may be aware there has recently been a recommendation by OpenAI & Google to the current US Administration that is gaining alarming traction to remove all legal protections & existing guardrails surrounding copyright law protections for the training of Artificial Intelligence. This rewriting of established law in favor of so-called âFair Useâ was in need of an initial response by 11:59 PM ET Saturday, so we have submitted an initial letter with the signatories we had at that time. We are now continuing to accept signatures for an amendment to our initial statement. Please feel free to forward this to anyone you think may be invested in the ethical maintenance of their intellectual property. You can add your name and whatever guilds or unions or description of self you feel appropriate, but please do not edit the letter itself. Thank you so much for kicking this out wide on a Saturday Night! Hollywoodâs Response to the Administrationâs Artificial Intelligence Action Plan and necessity that copyright law be upheld. We, the members of Americaâs entertainment industry â representing an intersection of cinematographers, directors, producers, actors, writers, studios, production companies, musicians, composers, costume, sound & production designers, editors, gaffers, union and Academy Members, and other industrious, creative content professionals â submit this unified statement in response to the Administrationâs request for input on the AI Action Plan. We firmly believe that Americaâs global AI leadership must not come at the expense of our essential creative industries. Americaâs arts and entertainment industry supports over 2.3M American jobs with over $229Bn in wages annually, while providing the foundation for American democratic influence and soft power abroad. But AI companies are asking to undermine this economic and cultural strength by weakening copyright protections for the films, television series, artworks, writing, music, and voices used to train AI models at the core of multi-billion dollar corporate valuations. Make no mistake: this issue goes well beyond the entertainment industry, as the right to train AI on all copyright-protected content impacts all of Americaâs knowledge industries. When tech and AI companies demand unfettered access to all data and information, theyâre not just threatening movies, books, and music, but the work of all writers, publishers, photographers, scientists, architects, engineers, designers, doctors, software developers and all other professionals who work with computers and generate intellectual property. These professions are the core of how we discover, learn, and share knowledge as a society and as a nation. This issue is not just about AI leadership or about economics and individual rights, but about Americaâs continued leadership in creating and owning valuable intellectual property in every field. It is clear that Google (valued at $2Tn) and OpenAI (valued at over $157Bn) are arguing for a special government exemption so they can freely exploit Americaâs creative and knowledge industries, despite their substantial revenues and available funds. There is no reason to weaken or eliminate the copyright protections that have helped America flourish. Not when AI companies can use our copyrighted material by simply doing what the law requires: negotiating appropriate licenses with copyright holders â just as every other industry does. Access to Americaâs creative catalog of films, writing, video content, and music is not a matter of national security. They do not require a government-mandated exemption from existing U.S. copyright law. America didnât become a global cultural powerhouse by accident. Our success stems directly from our fundamental respect for IP and copyright that rewards creative risk-taking by talented and hardworking Americans from every state and territory. For nearly 250 years, U.S. copyright law has balanced creatorâs rights with the needs of the public, creating the worldâs most vibrant creative economy. We recommend that the American AI Action Plan uphold existing copyright frameworks to maintain the strength of Americaâs creative and knowledge industries, as well as American cultural influence abroad.

The company on Thursday confirmed a tender offer where investors will buy up shares from those employees at a valuation of $91.5 billion. Stripe said it will also repurchase shares as part of the transaction. A spokesperson declined to say who is in the secondary round except to confirm that it is “largely” existing investors. Past backers of the company number at over 150 investors per PitchBook data . They include General Catalyst, GV, Silver Lake, Atomico, Elon Musk, Salesforce and many more. The tender offer is a decent jump on the company’s valuation from its last secondary sale a year ago, which was valued at $70 billion . However, Stripe still fell short of its high-watermark $95 billion valuation back in 2021. That round came at a time when e-commerce itself was booming due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it made Stripe, at the time and only on paper, the most valuable privately-held tech company in the world. The news coincides with Stripe’s annual letter penned by CEO and co-founder Patrick Collison, which noted that payment volume in 2024 grew to $1.4 trillion, up 38% on the year before. It’s a big number for Stripe, but to put it into some context, Visa said that its payment volume for 2024 was $13.2 trillion. The margin that Stripe makes on transactions (which are what make up payment volume) remains thin, and so this business remains one where it still has room to (and needs to) scale. Stripe also added that it is now used by half of the Fortune 100 companies, underscoring how it has catapulted from a startup working with other startups, into a major enterprise player. The tender offer was originally reported to be in the works earlier this month .

Generate Key Takeaways Tapestry’s Coach has filed a suit against the fast-fashion specialist Shein for trademark counterfeiting, federal trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair competition. The 30-page complaint was filed on Thursday in the U.S. District Court in the Central District of California by Tapestry Inc., Coach Services Inc. and Coach IP Holdings against Zoetop Business Co. and Shein U.S. Services. A juried trial is being sought. More from WWD Trump's Tariffs: The Hot-button Topic at AAFA Executive Summit in D.C. Jewelry Designer Pamela Love Sues Alex and Ani Beneficial Owners for Unpaid Consulting Fees and Sales Royalties Chanel and What Goes Around Comes Around Hear Final Judgment for Infringement Case Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The suit alleges that Shein used commerce marks that are “identical or substantially indistinguishable or confusingly similar to Coach trademarks in connection with the sale, distribution and/or advertising” of the alleged counterfeit products. The allegations include that when one searches for “coach” on Shein’s e-commerce site, there is “no indication” that any of the products originated from a third-party seller. When a shopper selects “what appears to be legitimate ‘ Coach ’ product for purchase, the third-party seller’s information is so small and inconspicuous that the shopper could “reasonably believe” that Shein was the seller with title or possession of the product. Attorneys for Tapestry and Coach did not respond immediately Tuesday afternoon to requests for comment, nor did an attorney for Shein. Representatives at both companies also had not returned media requests as of Tuesday afternoon. Designer dupes and fake fashion items are an ongoing issue for major brands. Nearly seven in 10 consumers were deceived into buying counterfeit products online at least once in 2023, according to research by Michigan State University’s College of Communication Arts and Sciences. Less than two years ago, the U.S. Congress passed the Integrity, Notification and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers Act to better inform consumers about third-party sellers and to reduce the number of fake and stolen goods that are sold online. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The complaint features multiple pages with photographs of the alleged counterfeit Coach products including tote bags, handbags, shoes, hats and purses. Tapestry alleges that Shein made, marketed and sold knockoff items that used the Coach name, logos, hardware and signature “C” designs. The products highlighted in the legal complaint were items that were sold through Shein’s marketplace platform, which allows third-party users to post product listings. Describing the “world of Chinese marketplaces” as a bit like the wild west, Neil Saunders, managing director for retail at GlobalData, said “it is hardly surprising that Tapestry wants to use the law as a taming influence. The complaint is legitimate inasmuch as Coach dupes are sold on Shein, and it’s almost impossible for the consumer to understand exactly what they’re buying. That’s detrimental to the Coach brand.” While it remains to be seen how the courts “interpret the technicalities of the law as the goods are sold by third parties rather than directly by Shein,” Saunders said, “Coach is trying to hold Shein fully liable. If they win, it will be a big victory for brands and will force Shein to take tough action on dupes and counterfeits.” Like its archrival in the fast-fashion sector Temu, Shein is facing multiple suits that have been brought forward by established brands and little-known artists for trademark infringement and counterfeit goods. The Tapestry-Shein legal action comes at a time when President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to stop ultra-cheap imports from entering the U.S. without tariffs.

Its growth numbers look impressive, and its AI platform is gaining traction across industries. Yet not everyone is convinced.

Despite its steady rise – its stock is up 15% year-to-date – Palantir has yet to fully overcome analysts’ doubts about its ability to maintain this pace. Nevertheless, one analyst from William Blair thinks Palantir’s recent move to partner with its foe, Databricks, is a game-changer. Palantir and Databricks Join Hands Last week, the company made a move that could change the game. Palantir partnered with Databricks, another big name in AI-driven data analytics. The two companies have often been seen as rivals, but now they’re working together to make their platforms more compatible. This isn’t a full merger of their tools, and they won’t be selling a joint product. Instead, they’re making it easier for businesses to use both systems side by side. Louie DiPalma, an analyst at William Blair, weighed in on the move, noting that while Palantir and Databricks compete in some areas, they rarely go head-to-head for contracts. The market, he said, is big enough for both. More importantly, the partnership makes sense for customers. “Since there are now many joint users, it makes sense for both of their data platforms to work nicely with each other,” he explained. Beyond commercial clients, the partnership could also be key in the government sector. The U.S. government recently issued an order requiring agencies to adopt better tracking systems for payments. Palantir, with its reputation for handling high-security data, stands to benefit. Working with Databricks strengthens its position as a go-to choice for agencies needing powerful AI tools. For Palantir, this partnership could be a turning point. It expands its reach, enhances its platform, and makes it more competitive against tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL) (GOOG) . However, the big question remains: will this be enough to finally convince skeptical investors that Palantir’s rise is just getting started? Is PLTR a Buy, Hold, or a Sell? Turning to Wall Street, Palantir is considered a Hold. The average price target for PLTR stock is $94.27 , implying a 7.92% upside potential.

In fact, we want to take anyone who goes to Mars,\" he said, adding, “that is the long-term goal of the company.\"\n\nWhen asked how long it could take for the company to accomplish this, he said, “I think we could do it in 20-30 years.”\n\nIt was SpaceX's Dragon aircraft that brought NASA astronautsSunita Williamsand Butch Wilmore, along with two other astronauts, back to earth on Wednesday, after being stranded aboard the International Space Station for nine months.\n\nIn a pose shared on X, Musk congratulated the team and thanked US President for prioritising the mission.\n\nWilmore and Williams arrived at the ISS last June on a Boeing spacecraft with plans to spend roughly a week in space. But that brief trip turned into roughly nine months whenNASAdecided in August the pair would come home on a rival SpaceX capsule instead, due to technical issues with their Boeing vehicle.\n\nTheir saga became an international spectacle, with some media outlets dubbing them the “stranded” astronauts — a nod to NASA’s reluctance to have them fly home in their original spacecraft.\n\nMusk said on March 15 that its massiveStarship rocket would leave for Mars at the end of 2026 with Tesla humanoid robot Optimus onboard, adding that human landings could follow \"as soon as 2029.\"\n\n\"Starship departs for Mars at the end of next year, carryingOptimus.

Cloud-based tools likeSlackandGoogle Drivehave helped teams communicate and share resources as easily across the hall as across the country, but just because all the resources you’ll need to get the job done are saved to shared folders or pinned to Slack channels doesn’t mean that they’re all equally accessible. This week, we’re hearing about OpenAI’s work on a new development that could do something about just that, linking Drive and Slack toChatGPT.\n\nThe company is working on a feature dubbed ChatGPT Connectors, according to a report fromTechCrunch. This would allow the chatbot to tap into shared work resources to address user queries. The system shares relevant data with ChatGPT over an encrypted connection, hopefully satisfying firms that might be a little nervous about letting an AI engine loose in an archive of company secrets, and will respect user permissions, so when you ask ChatGPT something it will only rely upon info in folders and channels you have access to for its response.\n\nParticularly private stuff like Slack DMs won’t be indexed by Connectors, and there are a few gaps in its skill set with shared files, not supporting images in documents, and having only a limited ability to read spreadsheet data.\n\nStill, this sounds like it has the potential to be incredibly useful, and especially so for remote workers. ChatGPT Connector hooked up to Google Drive and Slack could become the stand-in for that employee everyone’s always turning to for answers about policies, or best practices, able to instantly tap into that wealthy of company knowledge. In industries with a lot of turnover, that’s just going to be all the more valuable.\n\nSo far, OpenAI has yet to confirm for ChatGPT Connectors.

    "date": "2025-03-13T10:07:00+00:00",
    "full_content": "If you strip away all the buzzwords aboutenterprise artificial intelligence,such as \"agentic AI,\" the reality is that companies are learning what works in practice as they experiment with the technology, according to data tools giant Databricks.\n\nAlso:10 key reasons AI went mainstream overnight - and what happens next\n\n\"We're still learning where the right places are to put AI, where you can get the sweet spot of AI to help you solve a problem,\" said Databricks's chief AI scientist, Jonathan Frankle, in a recent interview he and I had in New York.\n\nDatabricks Chief AI scientist Jonathan Frankle.\n\nOn a basic level,generative AI, such as large language models, is making possible a new kind of enterprise analytics, said Frankle. Unstructured data, such as Word files, images, or videos, had no place in traditional data analytics before generative AI, noted Frankle. But now, it's a goldmine.\n\n\"Imagine tons and tons of unstructured documents, which are really tricky to analyze in a pre-generative AI or pre-LLM world, and suddenly you can extract meaningful features from them,\" he said. \"Data that was useless in an analytics world is now incredibly valuable here.\"\n\nAlso:Will synthetic data derail generative AI's momentum or be the breakthrough we need?\n\nWhile many people fixate on generative AI taking over actual programming code, a much simpler use would be to simply analyze a company's computer code.\n\n\"All the documentation for all of the code at your company\" was \"not really that useful as a data source in 2015, but, in 2025, incredibly valuable [...] just answering questions about your code for developers.\"\n\nSimilarly, \"You can imagine every single chat log from a customer service application with real humans, doing high-level analytics on that. What is the average number of interactions in a conversation? What is the average time to resolve an issue? Things that would not have been possible ten years ago.\"\n\nThe role of data is central in developing generative AI apps, said Frankle. Frankle came to Databricks whenit bought the machine learning startuphe was working for, MosaicML, in 2023. MosaicML focuses on optimizing the infrastructure for running AI, whereas Databricks is one of the leading purveyors of data lakes and technology to move and shape data.\n\nAlso:AI agents aren't just assistants: How they're changing the future of work today\n\n\"The whole thesis for the acquisition was that we had one piece, Databricks had a lot of other pieces, and it made much more sense together,\" said Frankle.\n\n\"You're trying to deploy an AI customer service bot. What data is that customer service bot working off of?\" Frankle explained. \"It's working off of customer information, it's working off your documentation, it's working off your SQL databases. That's all on Databricks.\"\n\nHaving the data together in Databricks is the beginning of creating the kinds of new analytics Frankle cites. WhileLLMscan make use of a pile of unstructured data, it doesn't hurt to get a company's data into some kind of structure beforehand.\n\n\"If you did the work in advance to use an LLM to pre-process that data into some kind of structured form, like SQL or JSON, you're asking for less work on the part of the AI -- you should always try to make things as easy as possible for the AI because these systems are definitely not infallible.\"\n\nAlso:8 out of 10 college students and administrators welcome AI agents\n\nAn important preparatory step is putting the data into what are called \"embeddings.\"\n\nAn \"embedding model\" is an AI model that is used to turn characters, words, or sentences into a vector -- a group of numbers -- that capture some of the semantic content of those characters, words, or sentences.\n\nYou can think of embeddings as numeric scores representing the relatedness of terms, such as \"apple\" to \"fruit,\" or \"baby\" to \"human.\"\n\nSimple language models, even relatively small ones, such as Google's BERT from 2018, can be used to make embeddings. \"You don't need huge models to get great embeddings,\" said Frankle.\n\nA lot of embedding models have been developed in the open-source community, noted Frankle, by adapting Meta Platforms' Llama model via the process known as fine-tuning.\n\nHowever, \"You might need to train a custom embedding model,\" given that existing ones are \"built on web data,\" making them very general.\n\nIn specific domains, such as healthcare, for example, a custom embedding model can find relationships between words and phrases better than a generic embedding model.\n\n\"We're finding that customizing embedding models can lead to disproportionately good retrieval improvement,\" said Frankle. \"We think there's still a lot of juice to squeeze out of just making them [embedding models] more specific to a domain.\"\n\nA well-developed embedding model is exceptionally important because \"they will make the heavy lifting that's done [by the large language model] a lot easier,\" he said.\n\nAlso:Is your business AI-ready? 5 ways to avoid falling behind\n\nMultiple embedding models can also be chained together, said Frankle. That can allow an AI model used in, for example, document search, to narrow down from a large group of a hundred documents to just a handful that answer a query.\n\nIn addition to tuning an embedding model, how data is fed into the embedding is its own area of excellence. \"When you provide these documents to an embedding model, you usually don't want to provide the whole document all at once,\" he said.\n\n\"You often want to chunk it into pieces,\" and how to do so optimally is also a matter of experimenting and trying approaches.\n\nFrankle added that Databricks is \"doing research on all of these topics because, in a lot of cases, we don't think the state of the art is good enough,\" including embeddings.\n\nWhile a lot can be \"plug and play\" via Databricks, says Frankle, \"the trickiest part is there's still a lot of experimentation. There are a lot of knobs that need to be turned. Should you fine-tune, or should you not fine-tune? How many documents should you try to retrieve and put in the context? What is your chunk size?\"\n\nBeyond the techniques, knowing what apps to build is itself a journey and something of a fishing expedition.\n\n\"I think the hardest part in AI is having confidence that this will work,\" said Frankle. \"If you came to me and said, 'Here's a problem in the healthcare space, here are the documents I have, do you think AI can do this?' my answer would be, 'Let's find out.'\"\n\nFrom what Frankle is seeing with customers, \"Applications that are getting into practice right now tend to look for things that are a little more open-ended,\" he said -- meaning what the AI model produces can be fuzzy, not necessarily specific. \"AI is great at producing an answer, not always great at producingtheanswer,\" he observed.\n\nAlso:Here's why you should ignore 99% of AI tools - and which four I use every day\n\n\"With AI, you can do fuzzy things, you can do document understanding in ways that I could never write a Python program for,\" Frankle explained.\n\n\"I also look for applications where it's relatively expensive to come to an answer but relatively cheap to check the answer.\" An example is the automatic generation of textual notes for a doctor from recordings of his patient exams. \"A draft set of patient notes can be generated, they [the doctor or doctor's assistant] can check it, tweak a couple of things, and call it a day.\" That's a useful way to eliminate tedium, he said.\n\nConversely, \"Applications where you need the right answer, and they're hard to check\" may be something to avoid for now. He gave the example of drafting a legal document. \"If the AI misses one thing, the human now needs to go and review the whole document to make sure they didn't miss anything else. So, what was the point of using the AI?\" Frankle observed.\n\nOn the other hand, there is lots of potential for AI to do things such as take over grunt work for lawyers and paralegals and, as a result, broaden the access people have to lawyers.\n\nAlso:Want to win in the age of AI? You can either build it or build your business with it\n\n\"Suppose that AI could automate some of the most boring legal tasks that exist?\" offered Frankle, whose parents are lawyers. \"If you wanted an AI to help you do legal research, and help you ideate about how to solve a problem, or help you find relevant materials -- phenomenal!\"\n\n\"We're still in very early days\" of generative AI, \"and so, kind of, we're benefiting from the strengths, but we're still learning how to mitigate the weaknesses.\"\n\nIn the midst of uncertainty, Frankle is impressed with how customers have quickly traversed the learning curve. \"Two or three years ago, there was a lot of explaining to customers what generative AI was,\" he noted. \"Now, when I talk to customers, they're using vector databases.\"\n\n\"These folks have a great intuition for where these things are succeeding and where they aren't,\" he said of Databricks customers.\n\nGiven that no company has an unlimited budget, Frankle advised starting with an initial prototype, so that investment only proceeds to the extent that it's clear an AI app will provide value.\n\nAlso:Even premium AI tools distort the news and fabricate links - these are the worst\n\n\"It should be something you can throw together in a day usingGPT-4, and a handful of documents you already have,\" he offered. The developer can enlist \"a couple random people from around the company who can tell you you're on the right track here or not.\"\n\nFor managers, Frankle advises making exploration of generative AI a part of the job on a regular basis.\n\n\"People are motivated,\" such as data scientists, he noted. \"It's even less about the money and more about just giving them the time and saying, as part of your job responsibilities, take a couple weeks, do a two-day hackathon, and just go see what you can do. That's really exciting for people.\"\n\nThe motto in enterprise generative AI might be, from tiny acorns grow mighty oaks.\n\nAs Frankle put it, \"The person who happens to have that GPU in their basement, and is playing with Llama, actually is very sophisticated, and could be the generative AI expert of tomorrow.\"",

You can read more about oureditorial guidelinesand thebanking methodologyfor the ratings below.\n\nRevolut was launched in the United Kingdom in 2015 and has since grown to a global financial enterprise providing services to customers in 38 countries. More than 35 million consumers and 500,000 business customers use Revolut’s financial products, including its money management and investing platform, prepaid cards, andsavings accounts.\n\nRevolut is a digital company with no local branches to visit, but 24/7 customer support is available via in-app chat. Unfortunately, only Ultra Premium members can speak with a customer representative on the phone, and only UK customers can obtain Ultra Premium accounts. U.S. Customers have no telephone support options.\n\nRevolut also doesn’t personally hold your funds; instead, money put into your savings account is held at Sutton Bank and is covered byFDIC insuranceup to $250,000.\n\nRevolut offers a savings account, prepaid cards, and investing services. Different plan tiers, from Standard to Metal, have their own features and perks—and monthly fees.\n\nEach plan offered by Revolut includes aspects of both checking and savings accounts. However, it’s important to note that Revolut is not a traditional bank and does not offer separate checking and savings accounts. Here’s what you need to know about Revolut’s account options.\n\nRevolut does not offer separate checking and savings accounts. Instead, it offers a savings account with a prepaid card for daily financial management. There are three account tiers, two of which come with fees. Here are the accounts available.\n\nHere are the features of Revolut’s standard account:\n\nThe premium account offers all of the benefits of Revolut’s standard account, plus some additional perks. Here the the key features of Revolut’s premium account:\n\nMetal offers everything the standard and premium accounts do, along with these additional features:\n\nRevolut doesn’t offer certificates of deposit (CDs), money market accounts, credit cards or loans, but it does provide investing services. You can purchase cryptocurrencies, commodities and stocks with Revolut. More than 210 crypto tokens can be traded. You can also purchase commodities, including gold, silver, platinum and palladium, or trade more than 2,000 stocks commission-free.\n\nRevolut is a mobile-first platform. You’ll need the app to sign up, manage your funds, send and receive payments and use other Revolut features. Revolut currently has 4.7 out of 5 stars on the iOS store and 4.5 stars on the Google Play store. The app allows you to make payments in more than 25 currencies, send funds instantly with a click, and connect with customer support.\n\nLike Revolut, Wise is a multi-currency account that allows you to hold and convert dozens of currencies and move money across the globe. Revolut currently supports fewer currencies than Wise, although more currencies are coming.\n\nLike Revolut, Chime offers mobile-first banking and a card that works for payments worldwide. However, Chime accounts can only be opened by U.S. customers with a valid Social Security number, while Revolut offers services to customers across the globe.\n\nChime is mostly fee-free, except for withdrawals made from out-of-network ATMs. Revolut, on the other hand, charges users for many advanced services, including withdrawals above monthly limits.\n\nChime also offers faster access to your paychecks, up to two days early, and has a much better Better Business Bureau Rating and more positive online customer reviews than Revolut.\n\nSchwab Bank Investor checking offers investing and banking services, just as Revolut does—although you must be a Schwab investment customer to gain access to the checking account.\n\nSchwab offers its Investor Checking customers unlimited ATM fee rebates worldwide and no foreign transaction fees. Like Revolut, it has a full-featured mobile app to manage many banking services.\n\nSchwab does not have the focus on international customers and travel perks Revolut does. But it provides more traditional banking services—including access to loans and other financial products—and has local branches you can visit for customer support.\n\nForbes Advisor scores banks and credit unions on a number of factors, including the following:\n\nWe give separate ratings to the individual products offered by each financial institution, such as checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and CDs. We assign banks a rating from one and five stars, with one star being the lowest rating and five stars being the highest.\n\nTo learn about our rating system and review methodology, check out our guide onhow Forbes Advisor reviews banks.\n\nRevolut does not offer all of the features you’d expect from a standard bank, such as access to certificates of deposit. Customers will have to pay fees if they want more advanced features, and there is no in-person or phone customer support in the United States.\n\nRevolut is a legitimate business that has been operating since 2015. It has more than 50 million customers across over 140 countries and regions. Users have given the Revolut app stellar ratings, but the business lacks Better Business Bureau accreditation and reviews there are mixed. But Revolut’s partner bank in the U.S. is FDIC-insured, so your deposited funds are protected up to the $250,000 FDIC limit.\n\nYes, Revolut works in the United States. It debuted its financial services for Americans in March 2020 and reported in October 2023 that it had 840,000 customers in the U.S.",

    "full_content": "The Memphis City Council Tuesday evening gave final approval on selling 13 acres of land to an affiliate ofElon Musk's xAI company.\n\nAwater reuse plantwill be built on the property, neighboring the T.E. Maxon Water Treatment facility. The facility is expected toreduce strain on the Memphis Sand aquiferby 9%.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority's Allen Combined Cycle Plant and Nucor Steel’s Memphis plant will also use the water treated at the new facility in addition to xAI's data center. The water reuse facility is anticipated to cost $80 million to build.\n\nThe council approved the sale during its Feb. 18 meeting but had to vote on it a second time Tuesday. ACity of Memphis ordinancerequires two votes on property sales over $20,000. CTC Property LLC, an affiliate of xAI that bought the land, agreed to pay $820,000 for the 13 acres.\n\nTuesday's vote saw nine councilmembers vote in favor of the sale. Councilwoman Yolanda Cooper-Sutton voted against it — citing her support for the water reuse facility, but concern over residents not having their questions answered — and Councilwoman Rhonda Logan abstained from the vote.\n\nMultipleresidents from Boxtown and South Memphis voiced concernsover the speed with which Musk and xAI were moving in Memphis and the lack of community input. Others also said they were worried about the impact of using natural gas turbines to power the supercomputer.\n\nBoxtown and Westwood, two communities south of xAI's data facility, have experienced decades of air pollution from the industries near the neighborhoods.\n\n\"This affects people,\" executive director for Memphis Community Against Pollution KeShaun Pearson said during public comment Thursday. \"The people have been excluded. Something that [Councilman] JB Smiley [Jr.] said before is that 'We are all here to move the community forward, and in order to move the community forward, we have to include the community.' These people have to be included in the decisions that are being made.\"\n\nNeil Strebig is a journalist with The Commercial Appeal.
