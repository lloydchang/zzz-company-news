    "full_content": "Our Buyers Guide Top Picks\n\nThe UnaliWear Kanega Watch is a more discreet alternative to traditional medical alert devices. The watch weighs 49 grams (about 1.7 ounces). It’s 1.6 inches in diameter and 0.5 inches thick. It comes with a patented quick-swap battery, so you never have to take it off to charge.\n\nThe UnaliWear Kanega Watch is a stand-alone personal emergency response device, so you don’t need a landline or cellphone to make it work. Instead, it relies on Verizon’s nationwide cellular network. The watch connects to your home Wi-Fi but automatically switches to Verizon’s network when you leave your home.\n\nYou can call for help in multiple ways. If you press and hold the button on the right side of the watch (called the crown button) for a couple of seconds, you’ll be connected to the monitoring center. These trained professionals have your contact information and the names of your caregivers and know exactly whom to notify and where to dispatch help.\n\nYou can also use voice commands through the watch’s built-in microphone. Finally, if you fall, the watch automatically detects the unusual movement and notifies the monitors.\n\nUnaliWear offers two different pricing structures for the Kanega Watch. You can make an upfront payment for the whole year, or you can pay monthly from the start. No matter how you pay, you have a one-time setup fee.\n\nAs of publishing, if you choose to pay monthly from the start, your one-time setup fee is $299. Then, you’ll pay $69.95 a month for monitoring services.\n\nThere’s no contract with either payment structure, so you can cancel the service anytime. But note that the watch and the accessories aren’t yours to keep. You have to return everything in good condition if you cancel the monitoring service.\n\nDesigned with an older user in mind, the UnaliWear Kanega Watch has many features to help improve independence, including:\n\nCompare UnaliWear with othermedical alert companies.\n\nThe company name comes from the Cherokee words “Unalii,” which means friend, and “Kanega,” which means speak. When you put them together, you have a friend who speaks to you.\n\nUnaliWear covers defects in materials and workmanship for as long as you have it, as long as you are current on your service payments. If any issues come up, UnaliWear will replace the watch for free.\n\nThe company also covers replacement and shipping at no cost the first time you break the watch. Be aware that UnaliWear does not cover replacement of a watch in all circumstances.\n\nAfter 30 days, you can cancel the service at any time as long as you return all equipment. You’ll get a refund (minus a $75 restocking fee) if all equipment is returned in good condition. Annual plans will be issued a prorated refund based on the nondiscounted monthly rate of $69.95.\n\nTo cancel your monitoring service through UnaliWear, you need to call the company’s customer support team. As a part of the cancellation, you must send the equipment back in good condition. A lost or damaged watch results in a fee of up to $650.\n\nThe company’s headquarters is in Austin, Texas.\n\nUnaliWear helps vulnerable people enjoy more independence through its medical alert technology. The stylish Kanega Watch includes 24/7 U.S.-based monitoring, fall detection, medication reminders and a 30-day money-back guarantee. Since the watch uses Wi-Fi and LTE technologies, wearers don’t need a landline to access help. In addition, UnaliWear doesn’t require a long-term contract.\n\nShop with confidence\n\nCompare with top companies\n\nFilter by Rating\n\nPopular Mentions\n\nA link has directed you to this review. Its location on this page may change next time you visit.\n\nReviewed Sept. 17, 2024\n\nThe Kanega Watch has been a lifesaver for my grandma (and mom!). My grandma lives independently and is able to continue to do so because the Kanega provides round the clock coverage in the case of an emergency. And even better, my mom can rest easy, knowing she's safe. We chose the Kanega because the 24/7 monitoring service already knows who she is when an alert comes from the watch. After doing so much research online, we found that the Kanega's coverage and service was far superior to others on the market. Totally worth the price!\n\nReviewed March 12, 2024\n\nI bought this watch for my mother in December 2023. Two months later the screen went blank and it was not usable. I made several calls and wrote emails to the company's customer service department. The calls repeatedly were answered by the \"overflow\" service department, which was not qualified to actually troubleshoot problems. After a week of no response on how to fix the watch, I returned it. If you want a watch that detects falls and will notify emergency services, I would suggest an Apple Watch. The Apple Watch does everything the Kanega does and more, and it costs less.\n\nThanks for subscribing.\n\nYou have successfully subscribed to our newsletter! Enjoy reading our tips and recommendations.\n\nReviewed Feb. 17, 2024\n\nThe watch band was too large even though the wrist measured within the range for small. And the watch was heavy, too heavy for a small person to sleep when wearing. This may work better for larger folks, but if you're small, I would not recommend it. The $75 return fee is very steep and you need to go through customer service, which tries and tries to change your mind, to return it.\n\nReviewed Nov. 15, 2023\n\nWe got the Kanega Watch for my father several years ago. He loves it and he wears it all the time, which is the total point. The fall detection has worked as advertised, and he enjoys asking his watch for the time and date. Tremendous peace of mind for him and our whole family. I highly recommend!\n\nReviewed Oct. 22, 2023\n\nI purchased the watch on 9/6/2023, I received it around 9/11/2023. I lost a battery out of it on 10/2/2023, I had no idea how I lost it. Now on 10/22/2023 the watch band has broken where it attaches with the battery to watch. Very unhappy with the construction as I bought a battery for about $36 plus shipping about 3 weeks after purchase and now about 6 weeks later it is broken. I am emailing the company today to see what they will do about this situation. I paid $918.40. I would expect a better quality.\n\nReviewed Sept. 16, 2023\n\nThe service is great. There is very little set up and it is very easy to do. Once we received the watch there were 3 very short videos to watch and then you call the center and they do a test call with you. My Aunt loves the device because it isn't a pendant that gets in the way, flops around or looks out of place when she dresses up and goes out. She also likes the fact that she never has to take it off and can wear it in the shower.\n\nOur only complaint is that after only 3 months the first watch band broke where the battery goes in. We didn't realize it cracked and one battery was lost and then the band broke all together. I believe that a more rubberized battery chamber would be a better housing for the battery. The other disappointment was we had to pay $50 for shipping for a new watch. This seems a bit steep. We haven't found anything better at this time but the shipping cost did cause the luster of this product to dull somewhat.\n\nCheck out our buyers guide top picks\n\nOur Buyers Guide Top Picks:",

Today,Fort Health, a specialty outpatient pediatric mental health provider, announced that it has partnered withCollevato train its therapists with AI avatar-led, face-to-face simulations. By providing highly relevant and engaging customized scenarios, Fort Health is able to rapidly upskill its therapists using evidence-based therapeutic protocols, ultimately leading to improved client care and operational efficiency. The initial series of custom training scenarios resulted in 83% of clinicians feeling more prepared and 95% able to apply what they have learned.\n\nAbody of researchfrom the National Institute of Medicine shows that current efforts to train clinicians in empirically-based treatments (EBTs) face significant challenges, as they typically provide only didactic training with no examination of applied skills, follow-up support, or implementation feedback. Studies emphasize the importance of role-play skill practice and ongoing expert guidance to ensure clinicians maintain high fidelity to EBT protocols and deliver effective interventions to patients. Compounded by thebehavioral health care workforce shortage,these limitations underscore the need for innovative training approaches to address challenges in a cost-effective and scalable manner.\n\n\"AI-powered avatar simulations are revolutionizing therapist training by enabling immersive, risk-free practice of critical decision-making and patient interactions,\" saidNatalie Schneider, founding CEO of Fort Health. \"Colleva's AI coaching platform empowers us to design tailored, dynamic scenarios that mirror real-world challenges, providing therapists with hands-on experience in applying evidence-based treatment protocols. By leveraging AI patient avatars, we are transforming mental health training—making it more proactive, personalized, and scalable to meet the growing demand for high-quality care.\"\n\nHow it Works\n\nUsing Fort Health's agentic AI training platform – which is modeled on the evidence-based treatment protocol, the Unified Protocol for children, adolescents, and caregivers – therapists conduct realistic role plays with custom avatars and receive personalized feedback to identify areas for improvement and highlight strengths. The series of interactive scenarios are a safe space to practice and develop therapeutic techniques. To help therapists build and demonstrate their proficiency, there are three scenarios representative of the patient population that Fort Health treats. Each of the scenario's avatars have six personalities to choose from, allowing for more realistic and varied practice. Each custom simulation uses generative AI to analyze both content and delivery. Personalized feedback is based on specific EBT objectives and CBT competency frameworks. Therapists are also provided instant feedback on soft skill competencies important to successful therapy outcomes.\n\n\"We are harnessing AI not to replace human therapists, but to make them more effective,\" saidMichael Palys, co-founder and president of Colleva. \"It's been wonderful working in partnership with the Fort Health team as they share our collective vision of using AI role plays and simulations to enhance human skills in areas like mental health where these skills are so critically important to successful patient outcomes. The ability to offer personalized 1:1 feedback at scale is a game changer. My father's own career in psychiatry has made this particular project very special to me, and it's been wonderful to see the excitement among practitioners.\"\n\n\"As a therapist, I know how challenging it can be to translate the professional training we receive into real life interactions with children and families. I also know how uncomfortable and anxiety provoking it can be for a therapist to participate in role plays or live observations. Having a private, safe space to fumble and trip as you sharpen your skill set is a game changer for most therapists,\" saidLindsay Henderson, PsyD, founding clinical director, Fort Health. \"Utilizing AI simulations as a training platform to increase therapist's ability to deliver EBT at a higher fidelity will be key to solving for our nation's youth mental health needs.\"\n\n\"What a unique training opportunity! It allows me to practice and improve my clinical skills in a way I've never before experienced. I love getting immediate feedback which I can implement in real time,\" said Licensed Professional Counselor Catherine Murray.\n\nAbout Fort Health\n\nFounded in 2022, Fort Health is a specialty outpatient pediatric mental health provider.

    "full_content": "Our latest round-up of funding rounds in the digital health category features updates from Healthee, Aktiia, Moxe Health, Eleanor Health, Tava Health, BrainCheck, and Redi Health.\n\nHealtheehas raised $32 million in a Series A that will be used to scale up its operations, which are focused on a platform that provides a digital conduit between employees and their health plans. It answers questions about coverage, treatment, and benefits, provides advice on preventative care, and helps employers with the enrolment process.\n\nThe round was co-led by Fin Capital, Glilot Capital Partners, and Group11, with strategic partner TriNet also taking part. It will also be used for product development, according to the Israeli company, which was formed in 2018.\n\nSwitzerland’sAktiiahas raised CHF 27 million ($30 million) from investors including Redalpine and Khosla Ventures for the rollout and development of its wearable wristband device, which uses photoplethysmography technology to provide continuous blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period by detecting blood volume changes in small blood vessels.\n\nThe device is already approved in 44 countries and available in Switzerland, Germany, France, Austria, Italy, the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, and have been used in more than 60,000 patients. Aktiia will use the new funding in part to fund an expansion into the US market.\n\nHealthcare data exchange specialistMoxe Healthhas raised $25 million from investor Trinity Capital to support the development of its technology platform, used for the secure exchange of clinical and other sensitive data between healthcare payers and providers.\n\nIt is designed to provide a solution to the current problem of health data being in different formats and silos, with the aim of reducing administrative waste, relieving pressure on healthcare staff, eliminating duplicative efforts, and ultimately lowering costs. The latest cash infusion follows a $30 million second round in 2022 and a $5.5 million Series A for the Madison, Wisconsin-based company.\n\nEleanor Health, a company providing digital and face-to-face support for people struggling with substance use disorders (SUDs) and their families, has raised $22 million in an equity raise, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe Massachusetts-based start-up – which recently saw founding CEO Corbin Petro step down and be replaced by William McKinney – offers personalised addiction treatment either virtually or in person through a series of clinics in six US states. The latest round comes after it raised $50 million in Series C funding in 2022 and takes the total raised to date above the $100 million mark.\n\nNew York-basedTava Healthhas closed a $20 million Series B led by Catalyst Investors and featuring existing investors Peterson Partners, Toba Capital, and SpringTide, along with new backer Blue Heron Capital.\n\nThe company provides a telemedicine platform focused on mental health, connecting patients to therapists and supporting healthcare providers with practice management software, electronic medical records, and interactions with employers and health insurance companies. It said the new money would be used for product development, expansion of its provider network, and fostering new agreements with payers.\n\nBrainCheckhas raised $15 million that will be used to fuel the expansion and take-up of a recently launched update to its BrainCheck Screen digital cognitive assessment and care planning software for people with dementia. The app allows testing to be carried out on any internet-connect device and delivers an initial assessment in three minutes.\n\nThe financing round was led by Next Coast Ventures, S3 Ventures, and UPMC Enterprises, according to the Austin, Texas-based company, which said it would help accelerate the rollout of the new version.\n\nFinally, analytics companyRedi Healthhas closed a $14 million second round led by Blue Heron Capital that will be used to develop and expand its digital patient support programme (PSP) for people suffering from chronic health conditions.\n\nThe Columbus, Ohio start-up provides a number of services to its customers, including an app that tracks medications, symptoms, diet, and weight, and allows them to communicate and share progress with healthcare providers and link to other pertinent organisations, like drugmakers, pharmacies, and payers. It was founded in 2022, raising just under $4 million in a first round in 2022.",

    "date": "2024-06-03",
    "full_content": "For decades, thefashion industry has had an unlimited-growth mindset, fueled by cheap production and opacity. Even a seemingly simple question like \"What are your clothes made of?\" can flummox brands because fashion supply chains are so lengthy and far-flung.\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way, and AI could become a major force for a more sustainable industry.\n\nIn the past few years, brands have been accused of mislabeling their garments'fabric compositionandcountry of origin. A study conducted in the Netherlands involving about 7,000 garments found that41% of the garmentshad been mislabeled. Mislabeling poses an issue not just for curious consumers but for textile recyclers, who need to know exactly which fabrics they're dealing with in order to process them effectively.\n\nRecycling technologieshave improved over the past few decades, but vast piles of clothes need to be sorted first. This can be hard for workers to do accurately, and errors can be costly.\n\nWith their backgrounds intextile engineeringand AI, Sarika Bajaj and Tushita Gupta, the cofounders of Refiberd, spotted this accuracy problem in the late 2010s and understood that AI could help solve it.\n\nTo identify textiles, Refiberd uses AI and a sensor called a hyperspectral camera. \"It's almost like a video camera which pulls out near-infrared data,\" Bajaj told Business Insider. \"Light gets reflected onto our sensor, and that tells us what materials we're dealing with. What you end up with are spectra, graphs that tell you there's an extra 1% here of elastane or an extra 2% there of cotton.\"\n\nRefiberd tech uses a regression-based model, which estimates fabric composition and is more precise than a classification model that sorts materials into broad categories.\n\nBajaj said the regression-based model works with the help of a materials library made up of \"thousands upon thousands of samples,\" allowing Refiberd to \"detect textile material composition within 2% of the actual material composition.\"\n\nTo understand how we got here, it's worth breaking down exactly how fast fashion — the leading cause of the industry'stextile-waste problem— is made. Bajaj described the bulk of consumer-bought clothes as a \"notorious mix of blends and contaminants\" often manufactured in various factories worldwide.\n\n\"What we have found is that there's variability at every stage of the process,\" she said.\n\n\"We might see a garment made of organic cotton and think, 'Organic, amazing,'\" Bajaj added. \"Yet the process of dying organic, virgin cotton at a certain level just makes it a plastic.\"\n\nSynthetic dyesin garments require enormous amounts of water and contain contaminants. \"At what point do we still call this pure?\" Bajaj said. \"Then that garment might be sent off to a different factory for cut and sew, but those workers added polyester thread everywhere, and none of that has been accounted for on the label.\"\n\nA lack of regulation in the fashion industry meanscreative solutions are neededto tackle the problem. Leading in this field is the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel, or HKRITA, known for its sustainability-focused tech.\n\nIn addition to asmart garment-sorting system— which also uses hyperspectral cameras — HKRITA has several innovations designed to address what its CEO, Edwin Keh, sees as a deeper-rooted issue in the fashion industry: a refusal to consider product lifespan.\n\n\"There's a lack of thoughtfulness about reuse and second use,\" Keh said.\n\nHe said that whilealuminum beverage cans' high recycling ratescould be attributed partly to their use of a single material, the fashion industry's reliance on material blending to cut costs had complicated recycling. \"We use all sorts of blends and coatings,\" Keh said, \"because we just didn't think about second use.\"\n\nKeh described garment sorting as the \"big bottleneck,\" given how manual it is. But there are other remedies. HKRITA's projects include an AI-powered mechanical recycling system designed to identify reusable indigo-dyed warp yarns in denim and separate them from nonrecyclable synthetic yarns.\n\nBoth Refiberd and HKRITA have received cash awards from the H&M Foundation, a nonprofit funded by the founders of the H&M Group. The foundation, which says it aims to create a more \"socially inclusive and planet positive textile industry,\" has partnered with HKRITA on a program calledPlanet First.\n\nThe novelty of such innovations means securing investment can be a challenge. \"As a philanthropic organization, we can support these ideas when they're at a very critical stage and need funding to further develop, but they're too early for many investors,\" Anna Gedda, the global manager of the H&M Foundation, told BI. \"We can absorb that risk and support them to develop and scale.\"\n\nThe necessity of these solutions can't be underestimated.Tons of unwanted clothesare sent to landfills daily, and tons more are sold to traders who sort through clothes to find items of value and discard the rest. Rejected items aredumped out of sight, often in countries like Ghana, whose secondhand-clothes dealers havetaken a stand against this practice, or in remote locations like Chile's Atacama Desert, recently dubbedfast fashion's great garbage patch.",

    "full_content": "MARTIN, Tenn. – Dr. Cori Lathan, the chief executive officer of De Oro Devices and co-founder of AnthroTronix Inc., was the guest speaker at a College of Engineering and Natural Sciences STEMinar held April 22.\n\nLathan has a Ph.D. in neuroscience from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with degrees in aeronautics, astronautics, biopsychology and mathematics.\n\nHer work has been featured in Forbes, Time, The New Yorker and TEDx. She has been named Maryland’s Top Innovator of the Year, one of MIT Technology Review’s “Top 100 World Innovators.” The STEMinar featured a Q&amp;A session with Lathan that included students of Dr. Ashley Owens, assistant professor of engineering, and Women in STEM students and faculty.\n\nLathan also spent the morning touring the campus and its science facilities, laboratories and classrooms.\n\nThe term “STEM” – short for “Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics” – encompasses a broad range of academic disciplines and career pathways in those fields.\n\nIn introducing Lathan to the audience, UT Martin Provost and Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Dr. Philip Cavalier – who attended Swarthmore College with Lathan – told students that she is not focused in just one area.\n\n“I think that’s important,” he said. “I know all of you are learning specific areas of your major, and that’s important and fantastic. But, to get to the point where you’re an innovator and the CEO of a company and a faculty member and highly recognized, a big part of that is because Cori is interested in a wide range of things, curious about the world.”\n\nLathan founded a research and development company, AnthroTronix, which she ran for 20 years and still serves as a board member.\n\n“Biomedical engineering didn’t exist as a degree going through college,” she said. “That’s probably what I would have majored in now, but instead, I took lots of math and neuroscience and psychology and aerospace engineering.”\n\nLathan’s work has ranged from developing robots that assist children with disabilities to creating virtual reality environments for astronauts aboard the space station.\n\nLathan has also contributed to the development of wearable sensor technology and mobile medical applications for military personnel and clinicians.\n\nHer latest book, “Inventing the Future: Stories from a Techno-Optimist,” chronicles her decades- long journey in leveraging technology to improve the world.\n\nDr. Lily Pharris, assistant professor of computer science, was among the UT Martin faculty members to host Lathan on her visit to campus.\n\n“Having Dr. Cori Lathan visit UT Martin was an inspiring experience, especially for students pursuing careers in STEM fields,” she said. “Not too long ago, Dr. Lathan was sitting in a seat just like theirs — full of ambition, ideas and a desire to make a difference. Today, she stands as a powerful example of where following your passions, dreams and heart can lead.\n\n“Through her work as an inventor, entrepreneur and advocate for inclusive technology, Dr. Lathan showed our students that innovation isn’t just about building the future; it’s about shaping it with empathy, creativity and perseverance. I hope her story leaves a lasting impression, inspiring students to see themselves as the next generation ready to take up the torch and lead us toward an optimistic future.”\n\nMore information about Dr. Cori Lathan can be found at her website, inventthefuture.tech.\n\nFor more local news,click here.",
