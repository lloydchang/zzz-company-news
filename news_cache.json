    "full_content": "Our Buyers Guide Top Picks\n\nThe UnaliWear Kanega Watch is a more discreet alternative to traditional medical alert devices. The watch weighs 49 grams (about 1.7 ounces). It’s 1.6 inches in diameter and 0.5 inches thick. It comes with a patented quick-swap battery, so you never have to take it off to charge.\n\nThe UnaliWear Kanega Watch is a stand-alone personal emergency response device, so you don’t need a landline or cellphone to make it work. Instead, it relies on Verizon’s nationwide cellular network. The watch connects to your home Wi-Fi but automatically switches to Verizon’s network when you leave your home.\n\nYou can call for help in multiple ways. If you press and hold the button on the right side of the watch (called the crown button) for a couple of seconds, you’ll be connected to the monitoring center. These trained professionals have your contact information and the names of your caregivers and know exactly whom to notify and where to dispatch help.\n\nYou can also use voice commands through the watch’s built-in microphone. Finally, if you fall, the watch automatically detects the unusual movement and notifies the monitors.\n\nUnaliWear offers two different pricing structures for the Kanega Watch. You can make an upfront payment for the whole year, or you can pay monthly from the start. No matter how you pay, you have a one-time setup fee.\n\nAs of publishing, if you choose to pay monthly from the start, your one-time setup fee is $299. Then, you’ll pay $69.95 a month for monitoring services.\n\nThere’s no contract with either payment structure, so you can cancel the service anytime. But note that the watch and the accessories aren’t yours to keep. You have to return everything in good condition if you cancel the monitoring service.\n\nDesigned with an older user in mind, the UnaliWear Kanega Watch has many features to help improve independence, including:\n\nCompare UnaliWear with othermedical alert companies.\n\nThe company name comes from the Cherokee words “Unalii,” which means friend, and “Kanega,” which means speak. When you put them together, you have a friend who speaks to you.\n\nUnaliWear covers defects in materials and workmanship for as long as you have it, as long as you are current on your service payments. If any issues come up, UnaliWear will replace the watch for free.\n\nThe company also covers replacement and shipping at no cost the first time you break the watch. Be aware that UnaliWear does not cover replacement of a watch in all circumstances.\n\nAfter 30 days, you can cancel the service at any time as long as you return all equipment. You’ll get a refund (minus a $75 restocking fee) if all equipment is returned in good condition. Annual plans will be issued a prorated refund based on the nondiscounted monthly rate of $69.95.\n\nTo cancel your monitoring service through UnaliWear, you need to call the company’s customer support team. As a part of the cancellation, you must send the equipment back in good condition. A lost or damaged watch results in a fee of up to $650.\n\nThe company’s headquarters is in Austin, Texas.\n\nUnaliWear helps vulnerable people enjoy more independence through its medical alert technology. The stylish Kanega Watch includes 24/7 U.S.-based monitoring, fall detection, medication reminders and a 30-day money-back guarantee. Since the watch uses Wi-Fi and LTE technologies, wearers don’t need a landline to access help. In addition, UnaliWear doesn’t require a long-term contract.\n\nShop with confidence\n\nCompare with top companies\n\nFilter by Rating\n\nPopular Mentions\n\nA link has directed you to this review. Its location on this page may change next time you visit.\n\nReviewed Sept. 17, 2024\n\nThe Kanega Watch has been a lifesaver for my grandma (and mom!). My grandma lives independently and is able to continue to do so because the Kanega provides round the clock coverage in the case of an emergency. And even better, my mom can rest easy, knowing she's safe. We chose the Kanega because the 24/7 monitoring service already knows who she is when an alert comes from the watch. After doing so much research online, we found that the Kanega's coverage and service was far superior to others on the market. Totally worth the price!\n\nReviewed March 12, 2024\n\nI bought this watch for my mother in December 2023. Two months later the screen went blank and it was not usable. I made several calls and wrote emails to the company's customer service department. The calls repeatedly were answered by the \"overflow\" service department, which was not qualified to actually troubleshoot problems. After a week of no response on how to fix the watch, I returned it. If you want a watch that detects falls and will notify emergency services, I would suggest an Apple Watch. The Apple Watch does everything the Kanega does and more, and it costs less.\n\nThanks for subscribing.\n\nYou have successfully subscribed to our newsletter! Enjoy reading our tips and recommendations.\n\nReviewed Feb. 17, 2024\n\nThe watch band was too large even though the wrist measured within the range for small. And the watch was heavy, too heavy for a small person to sleep when wearing. This may work better for larger folks, but if you're small, I would not recommend it. The $75 return fee is very steep and you need to go through customer service, which tries and tries to change your mind, to return it.\n\nReviewed Nov. 15, 2023\n\nWe got the Kanega Watch for my father several years ago. He loves it and he wears it all the time, which is the total point. The fall detection has worked as advertised, and he enjoys asking his watch for the time and date. Tremendous peace of mind for him and our whole family. I highly recommend!\n\nReviewed Oct. 22, 2023\n\nI purchased the watch on 9/6/2023, I received it around 9/11/2023. I lost a battery out of it on 10/2/2023, I had no idea how I lost it. Now on 10/22/2023 the watch band has broken where it attaches with the battery to watch. Very unhappy with the construction as I bought a battery for about $36 plus shipping about 3 weeks after purchase and now about 6 weeks later it is broken. I am emailing the company today to see what they will do about this situation. I paid $918.40. I would expect a better quality.\n\nReviewed Sept. 16, 2023\n\nThe service is great. There is very little set up and it is very easy to do. Once we received the watch there were 3 very short videos to watch and then you call the center and they do a test call with you. My Aunt loves the device because it isn't a pendant that gets in the way, flops around or looks out of place when she dresses up and goes out. She also likes the fact that she never has to take it off and can wear it in the shower.\n\nOur only complaint is that after only 3 months the first watch band broke where the battery goes in. We didn't realize it cracked and one battery was lost and then the band broke all together. I believe that a more rubberized battery chamber would be a better housing for the battery. The other disappointment was we had to pay $50 for shipping for a new watch. This seems a bit steep. We haven't found anything better at this time but the shipping cost did cause the luster of this product to dull somewhat.\n\nCheck out our buyers guide top picks\n\nOur Buyers Guide Top Picks:",

Today,Fort Health, a specialty outpatient pediatric mental health provider, announced that it has partnered withCollevato train its therapists with AI avatar-led, face-to-face simulations. By providing highly relevant and engaging customized scenarios, Fort Health is able to rapidly upskill its therapists using evidence-based therapeutic protocols, ultimately leading to improved client care and operational efficiency. The initial series of custom training scenarios resulted in 83% of clinicians feeling more prepared and 95% able to apply what they have learned.\n\nAbody of researchfrom the National Institute of Medicine shows that current efforts to train clinicians in empirically-based treatments (EBTs) face significant challenges, as they typically provide only didactic training with no examination of applied skills, follow-up support, or implementation feedback. Studies emphasize the importance of role-play skill practice and ongoing expert guidance to ensure clinicians maintain high fidelity to EBT protocols and deliver effective interventions to patients. Compounded by thebehavioral health care workforce shortage,these limitations underscore the need for innovative training approaches to address challenges in a cost-effective and scalable manner.\n\n\"AI-powered avatar simulations are revolutionizing therapist training by enabling immersive, risk-free practice of critical decision-making and patient interactions,\" saidNatalie Schneider, founding CEO of Fort Health. \"Colleva's AI coaching platform empowers us to design tailored, dynamic scenarios that mirror real-world challenges, providing therapists with hands-on experience in applying evidence-based treatment protocols. By leveraging AI patient avatars, we are transforming mental health training—making it more proactive, personalized, and scalable to meet the growing demand for high-quality care.\"\n\nHow it Works\n\nUsing Fort Health's agentic AI training platform – which is modeled on the evidence-based treatment protocol, the Unified Protocol for children, adolescents, and caregivers – therapists conduct realistic role plays with custom avatars and receive personalized feedback to identify areas for improvement and highlight strengths. The series of interactive scenarios are a safe space to practice and develop therapeutic techniques. To help therapists build and demonstrate their proficiency, there are three scenarios representative of the patient population that Fort Health treats. Each of the scenario's avatars have six personalities to choose from, allowing for more realistic and varied practice. Each custom simulation uses generative AI to analyze both content and delivery. Personalized feedback is based on specific EBT objectives and CBT competency frameworks. Therapists are also provided instant feedback on soft skill competencies important to successful therapy outcomes.\n\n\"We are harnessing AI not to replace human therapists, but to make them more effective,\" saidMichael Palys, co-founder and president of Colleva. \"It's been wonderful working in partnership with the Fort Health team as they share our collective vision of using AI role plays and simulations to enhance human skills in areas like mental health where these skills are so critically important to successful patient outcomes. The ability to offer personalized 1:1 feedback at scale is a game changer. My father's own career in psychiatry has made this particular project very special to me, and it's been wonderful to see the excitement among practitioners.\"\n\n\"As a therapist, I know how challenging it can be to translate the professional training we receive into real life interactions with children and families. I also know how uncomfortable and anxiety provoking it can be for a therapist to participate in role plays or live observations. Having a private, safe space to fumble and trip as you sharpen your skill set is a game changer for most therapists,\" saidLindsay Henderson, PsyD, founding clinical director, Fort Health. \"Utilizing AI simulations as a training platform to increase therapist's ability to deliver EBT at a higher fidelity will be key to solving for our nation's youth mental health needs.\"\n\n\"What a unique training opportunity! It allows me to practice and improve my clinical skills in a way I've never before experienced. I love getting immediate feedback which I can implement in real time,\" said Licensed Professional Counselor Catherine Murray.\n\nAbout Fort Health\n\nFounded in 2022, Fort Health is a specialty outpatient pediatric mental health provider.

    "full_content": "Our latest round-up of funding rounds in the digital health category features updates from Healthee, Aktiia, Moxe Health, Eleanor Health, Tava Health, BrainCheck, and Redi Health.\n\nHealtheehas raised $32 million in a Series A that will be used to scale up its operations, which are focused on a platform that provides a digital conduit between employees and their health plans. It answers questions about coverage, treatment, and benefits, provides advice on preventative care, and helps employers with the enrolment process.\n\nThe round was co-led by Fin Capital, Glilot Capital Partners, and Group11, with strategic partner TriNet also taking part. It will also be used for product development, according to the Israeli company, which was formed in 2018.\n\nSwitzerland’sAktiiahas raised CHF 27 million ($30 million) from investors including Redalpine and Khosla Ventures for the rollout and development of its wearable wristband device, which uses photoplethysmography technology to provide continuous blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period by detecting blood volume changes in small blood vessels.\n\nThe device is already approved in 44 countries and available in Switzerland, Germany, France, Austria, Italy, the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, and have been used in more than 60,000 patients. Aktiia will use the new funding in part to fund an expansion into the US market.\n\nHealthcare data exchange specialistMoxe Healthhas raised $25 million from investor Trinity Capital to support the development of its technology platform, used for the secure exchange of clinical and other sensitive data between healthcare payers and providers.\n\nIt is designed to provide a solution to the current problem of health data being in different formats and silos, with the aim of reducing administrative waste, relieving pressure on healthcare staff, eliminating duplicative efforts, and ultimately lowering costs. The latest cash infusion follows a $30 million second round in 2022 and a $5.5 million Series A for the Madison, Wisconsin-based company.\n\nEleanor Health, a company providing digital and face-to-face support for people struggling with substance use disorders (SUDs) and their families, has raised $22 million in an equity raise, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe Massachusetts-based start-up – which recently saw founding CEO Corbin Petro step down and be replaced by William McKinney – offers personalised addiction treatment either virtually or in person through a series of clinics in six US states. The latest round comes after it raised $50 million in Series C funding in 2022 and takes the total raised to date above the $100 million mark.\n\nNew York-basedTava Healthhas closed a $20 million Series B led by Catalyst Investors and featuring existing investors Peterson Partners, Toba Capital, and SpringTide, along with new backer Blue Heron Capital.\n\nThe company provides a telemedicine platform focused on mental health, connecting patients to therapists and supporting healthcare providers with practice management software, electronic medical records, and interactions with employers and health insurance companies. It said the new money would be used for product development, expansion of its provider network, and fostering new agreements with payers.\n\nBrainCheckhas raised $15 million that will be used to fuel the expansion and take-up of a recently launched update to its BrainCheck Screen digital cognitive assessment and care planning software for people with dementia. The app allows testing to be carried out on any internet-connect device and delivers an initial assessment in three minutes.\n\nThe financing round was led by Next Coast Ventures, S3 Ventures, and UPMC Enterprises, according to the Austin, Texas-based company, which said it would help accelerate the rollout of the new version.\n\nFinally, analytics companyRedi Healthhas closed a $14 million second round led by Blue Heron Capital that will be used to develop and expand its digital patient support programme (PSP) for people suffering from chronic health conditions.\n\nThe Columbus, Ohio start-up provides a number of services to its customers, including an app that tracks medications, symptoms, diet, and weight, and allows them to communicate and share progress with healthcare providers and link to other pertinent organisations, like drugmakers, pharmacies, and payers. It was founded in 2022, raising just under $4 million in a first round in 2022.",

    "date": "2024-06-03",
    "full_content": "For decades, thefashion industry has had an unlimited-growth mindset, fueled by cheap production and opacity. Even a seemingly simple question like \"What are your clothes made of?\" can flummox brands because fashion supply chains are so lengthy and far-flung.\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way, and AI could become a major force for a more sustainable industry.\n\nIn the past few years, brands have been accused of mislabeling their garments'fabric compositionandcountry of origin. A study conducted in the Netherlands involving about 7,000 garments found that41% of the garmentshad been mislabeled. Mislabeling poses an issue not just for curious consumers but for textile recyclers, who need to know exactly which fabrics they're dealing with in order to process them effectively.\n\nRecycling technologieshave improved over the past few decades, but vast piles of clothes need to be sorted first. This can be hard for workers to do accurately, and errors can be costly.\n\nWith their backgrounds intextile engineeringand AI, Sarika Bajaj and Tushita Gupta, the cofounders of Refiberd, spotted this accuracy problem in the late 2010s and understood that AI could help solve it.\n\nTo identify textiles, Refiberd uses AI and a sensor called a hyperspectral camera. \"It's almost like a video camera which pulls out near-infrared data,\" Bajaj told Business Insider. \"Light gets reflected onto our sensor, and that tells us what materials we're dealing with. What you end up with are spectra, graphs that tell you there's an extra 1% here of elastane or an extra 2% there of cotton.\"\n\nRefiberd tech uses a regression-based model, which estimates fabric composition and is more precise than a classification model that sorts materials into broad categories.\n\nBajaj said the regression-based model works with the help of a materials library made up of \"thousands upon thousands of samples,\" allowing Refiberd to \"detect textile material composition within 2% of the actual material composition.\"\n\nTo understand how we got here, it's worth breaking down exactly how fast fashion — the leading cause of the industry'stextile-waste problem— is made. Bajaj described the bulk of consumer-bought clothes as a \"notorious mix of blends and contaminants\" often manufactured in various factories worldwide.\n\n\"What we have found is that there's variability at every stage of the process,\" she said.\n\n\"We might see a garment made of organic cotton and think, 'Organic, amazing,'\" Bajaj added. \"Yet the process of dying organic, virgin cotton at a certain level just makes it a plastic.\"\n\nSynthetic dyesin garments require enormous amounts of water and contain contaminants. \"At what point do we still call this pure?\" Bajaj said. \"Then that garment might be sent off to a different factory for cut and sew, but those workers added polyester thread everywhere, and none of that has been accounted for on the label.\"\n\nA lack of regulation in the fashion industry meanscreative solutions are neededto tackle the problem. Leading in this field is the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel, or HKRITA, known for its sustainability-focused tech.\n\nIn addition to asmart garment-sorting system— which also uses hyperspectral cameras — HKRITA has several innovations designed to address what its CEO, Edwin Keh, sees as a deeper-rooted issue in the fashion industry: a refusal to consider product lifespan.\n\n\"There's a lack of thoughtfulness about reuse and second use,\" Keh said.\n\nHe said that whilealuminum beverage cans' high recycling ratescould be attributed partly to their use of a single material, the fashion industry's reliance on material blending to cut costs had complicated recycling. \"We use all sorts of blends and coatings,\" Keh said, \"because we just didn't think about second use.\"\n\nKeh described garment sorting as the \"big bottleneck,\" given how manual it is. But there are other remedies. HKRITA's projects include an AI-powered mechanical recycling system designed to identify reusable indigo-dyed warp yarns in denim and separate them from nonrecyclable synthetic yarns.\n\nBoth Refiberd and HKRITA have received cash awards from the H&M Foundation, a nonprofit funded by the founders of the H&M Group. The foundation, which says it aims to create a more \"socially inclusive and planet positive textile industry,\" has partnered with HKRITA on a program calledPlanet First.\n\nThe novelty of such innovations means securing investment can be a challenge. \"As a philanthropic organization, we can support these ideas when they're at a very critical stage and need funding to further develop, but they're too early for many investors,\" Anna Gedda, the global manager of the H&M Foundation, told BI. \"We can absorb that risk and support them to develop and scale.\"\n\nThe necessity of these solutions can't be underestimated.Tons of unwanted clothesare sent to landfills daily, and tons more are sold to traders who sort through clothes to find items of value and discard the rest. Rejected items aredumped out of sight, often in countries like Ghana, whose secondhand-clothes dealers havetaken a stand against this practice, or in remote locations like Chile's Atacama Desert, recently dubbedfast fashion's great garbage patch.",

    "full_content": "MARTIN, Tenn. – Dr. Cori Lathan, the chief executive officer of De Oro Devices and co-founder of AnthroTronix Inc., was the guest speaker at a College of Engineering and Natural Sciences STEMinar held April 22.\n\nLathan has a Ph.D. in neuroscience from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with degrees in aeronautics, astronautics, biopsychology and mathematics.\n\nHer work has been featured in Forbes, Time, The New Yorker and TEDx. She has been named Maryland’s Top Innovator of the Year, one of MIT Technology Review’s “Top 100 World Innovators.” The STEMinar featured a Q&amp;A session with Lathan that included students of Dr. Ashley Owens, assistant professor of engineering, and Women in STEM students and faculty.\n\nLathan also spent the morning touring the campus and its science facilities, laboratories and classrooms.\n\nThe term “STEM” – short for “Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics” – encompasses a broad range of academic disciplines and career pathways in those fields.\n\nIn introducing Lathan to the audience, UT Martin Provost and Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Dr. Philip Cavalier – who attended Swarthmore College with Lathan – told students that she is not focused in just one area.\n\n“I think that’s important,” he said. “I know all of you are learning specific areas of your major, and that’s important and fantastic. But, to get to the point where you’re an innovator and the CEO of a company and a faculty member and highly recognized, a big part of that is because Cori is interested in a wide range of things, curious about the world.”\n\nLathan founded a research and development company, AnthroTronix, which she ran for 20 years and still serves as a board member.\n\n“Biomedical engineering didn’t exist as a degree going through college,” she said. “That’s probably what I would have majored in now, but instead, I took lots of math and neuroscience and psychology and aerospace engineering.”\n\nLathan’s work has ranged from developing robots that assist children with disabilities to creating virtual reality environments for astronauts aboard the space station.\n\nLathan has also contributed to the development of wearable sensor technology and mobile medical applications for military personnel and clinicians.\n\nHer latest book, “Inventing the Future: Stories from a Techno-Optimist,” chronicles her decades- long journey in leveraging technology to improve the world.\n\nDr. Lily Pharris, assistant professor of computer science, was among the UT Martin faculty members to host Lathan on her visit to campus.\n\n“Having Dr. Cori Lathan visit UT Martin was an inspiring experience, especially for students pursuing careers in STEM fields,” she said. “Not too long ago, Dr. Lathan was sitting in a seat just like theirs — full of ambition, ideas and a desire to make a difference. Today, she stands as a powerful example of where following your passions, dreams and heart can lead.\n\n“Through her work as an inventor, entrepreneur and advocate for inclusive technology, Dr. Lathan showed our students that innovation isn’t just about building the future; it’s about shaping it with empathy, creativity and perseverance. I hope her story leaves a lasting impression, inspiring students to see themselves as the next generation ready to take up the torch and lead us toward an optimistic future.”\n\nMore information about Dr. Cori Lathan can be found at her website, inventthefuture.tech.\n\nFor more local news,click here.",

    "full_content": "HOUSTON,Jan. 03, 2019/PRNewswire-PRWeb/ --BrainCheck, aTexas-based digital neurocognitive testing platform, has raised$1.5 millionin additional capital to bring AI and personalized medicine to dementia care through its cognitive care management technology, BrainCheck Care, which launched inJuly 2018. Funding, led byTrue Wealth Ventures, with participation fromTensility Venture Partners,XFactor Ventures,S3 Venturesand angel investors, brings the total funding to$6 millionto date.\n\nBorn at the Eagleman Neuroscience Laboratory atBaylor College of Medicine(now atStanford), BrainCheck enables physicians to rapidly and accurately assess cognitive function and deliver cognitive care at scale. The platform is currently used by hundreds of clinical practices and over 40,000 individuals and is growing rapidly. As first to market with an end-to-end cognitive health solution, BrainCheck is well-positioned to change millions of lives by providing a much-needed and promising solution to the \"silver tsunami.\"\n\nThere are5.7 million people suffering with dementiain the U.S. today, according to the Alzheimer's Association. The cost to healthcare organizations is 50 percent greater than cancer or heart disease. But new research from The Lancet Commission shows that one-third of dementia is preventable, and disease progression can be slowed through effective detection and addressing modifiable risk factors. As digital medicine continues to transform patient care, BrainCheck occupies a unique position to meet the needs of the dementia market.\n\nThrough a combination of assessments, screeners, workflows and clinical decision support algorithms, BrainCheck Care enables physicians to provide a detailed, personalized care plan to the patient and caregiver at the point of care.\n\n\"BrainCheck's rich and robust dataset on cognitive health, paired with other health and biometric data, enable us to personalize dementia care at scale,\" saidDr.Yael Katz, co-founder and CEO of BrainCheck. \"For the first time, clinicians and caregivers can observe whether interventions are working by tracing cognitive change to a patient's medications, chronic diseases, or lifestyle, and iterate on these interventions to optimize outcomes.\"\n\nChicago-based Tensility Venture Partners focuses its investments on enterprise AI companies. \"We saw a great opportunity with BrainCheck,\" saidArmando Pauker, managing director and co-founder at Tensility Venture Partners. \"They're sitting on a treasure trove of difficult-to-obtain data and are addressing a large market opportunity. They bring the power and benefits of AI into clinical care to make cognitive testing easily available to all.\"\n\n\"The research is clear and it has now been clinically proven that patients can delay the onset of dementia,\" saidCharlie Plauche, partner at S3 Ventures. \"By helping physicians detect this debilitating disease early, BrainCheck's platform technology will improve the lives of millions in the coming years.\"\n\nHeadquartered at the Texas Medical Center Innovation Institute, TMCx, BrainCheck has recently opened a second office inAustin, Texas.

    "full_content": "As the world’s population ages, more is being learned about brain health as startups leverage technology to find a way to slow down cognitive impairment.\n\nBrainCheck, a Houston- and Austin-based company developing cognitive healthcare software to aid physicians in detecting and managing this type of care, raised $10 million in Series B funding to expand its R&D and go-to-market capabilities as it works on new digital therapeutics for Alzheimer’s and related dementias.\n\nThe round was led by Next Coast Ventures and S3 Ventures, which were joined by Nueterra Capital, Tensility Ventures and True Wealth Ventures. In addition, UPMC Enterprises and SelectQuote came on as strategic investors. The latest funding gives the company roughly $21 million in total funding raised to date, which includes a$3 million seed roundin 2016 and$8 million in Series A fundingfrom 2019.\n\nThis startup just raised $8 million to help busy doctors assess the cognitive health of 50 million seniors\n\nBrainCheck’s technology acts as a bridge between patients and the limited number of neurologists, about 12,000, in the U.S. Through 10- to 15-minute tests, performed in-person or remote (via a smartphone, tablet or computer), cognitive function can be detected early and more accurately.\n\nBased on the test, patients are assigned a Cognitive Quotient (CQ) score, which is then used to produce a personalized cognitive care plan within minutes. Over 400 neurology, primary care and geriatrics practices use the technology currently, including Mount Sinai clinicians, which are using it to track and manage cognitive impairment resulting from COVID-19.\n\nThe pandemic has changed everything across the healthcare ecosystem, Yael Katz, PhD, co-founder and CEO of BrainCheck, told TechCrunch via email.\n\nThe company always had it in mind to raise another round two years after its Series A, but Katz said the global pandemic gave them pause to see how it would impact that decision. However, due to COVID shining a light on how people perceive healthcare and became more comfortable with remote care, they saw an opportunity to continue.\n\nThe new funding will enable the company to continue to grow its team and invest in R&D. It already has several new initiatives in the works to close the loop with the patient journey that will be brought to market soon, she added.\n\nOver the last year, BrainCheck experienced year over year revenue growth increase three times, and Katz expects the same trajectory for next year. With the Series B, the goal remains the same as it was two years ago — double down on growth.\n\n“From the shift to remote work and an increased prioritization of mental health, to investing in preventive medicine and supporting the aging population, all of these factors have come together to make the case that what we’re doing matters, and will continue to matter,” she said. “It’s never been more important for physicians to invest in a tool like BrainCheck and improve treatment across the patient journey.”\n\nThe next healthcare revolution will have AI at its center\n\nTopics\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nChristine Hall wrote about enterprise/B2B, e-commerce, and foodtech for TechCrunch, and venture capital rounds for Crunchbase News.

The report highlights significant healthcare disparities in women’s health, and the urgent need for better solutions, and provides actionable recommendations to improve women's health outcomes.\n\n\"We're excited to share this white paper, which dives into the real challenges women face with their mental and sexual health,\" said Liz Weir, Chief Marketing Officer of LevLane and co-author of the study. \"As an agency, our mission is to uncover insights that spark meaningful conversations and positive changes. We hope this research not only highlights these critical issues but also inspires better ideas and solutions for our clients and the wider market to truly support women's well-being.\"\n\nData from the research reveals that women experiencing sexual problems are 30% more likely to have poor health and 15% more likely to report low sex satisfaction.\n\nAdditionally, nearly 50% of women cite some type of mental health concern as their top health priority, with issues like depression and anxiety significantly impacting sexual well-being.\n\nLyndsey Harper, MD, CEO of Rosy Wellness, and co-author of the white paper, said, \"This research is incredibly important when it comes to understanding how critical the need for comprehensive and expert-led solutions in women’s health is.

The auditory cue is a metronome,\" she explained. \"So you visualize yourself stepping over that green laser line, stepping to the beat of the metronome. Just by changing the intention behind the movement, by setting that goal, we're changing the part of the brain that's been activated, that allows someone to be able to restore mobility.\"\n\nCollin is happy to see NexStride restoring mobility for people like Hallmark.\n\n\"I am able to walk or take my dog for walks,\" Hallmark said. \"I'm able to get out and go shopping, grocery shopping for my wife -- just do different things like that.\"\n\nThe device is $499 and it's 100% covered for veterans through Veterans Affairs, as well as the Parkinson's Wellness Fund organization.",

It also resulted in more individuals receiving important screening tests and services, including blood pressure screening (42.8% versus 28.3%), weight assessment (42.8% versus 27.7%), and depression screening (32.8% versus 16.8%).\n\n“Our findings indicate that a multifaceted and relatively low-resource behavioral economic intervention may improve postpartum health and well-being,” said Clapp.\"As a primary care physician, I have frequently observed how care is improved for individual patients by a careful transition between obstetrics and primary care,\" saysAlaka Ray, MD, a Mass General primary care physician and an author of the study. \"It is wonderful that this study has now demonstrated the importance of that connection in the form of significant benefits for postpartum patients with high-risk conditions.\"\"I would also note that this study population is comprised of patients who already had an established primary care physician. We all know, however, that many others cannot find a primary care physician,\" says Ray. \"It is my hope that this study will add further urgency to the call to address our worsening primary care shortage so that evidence-based interventions like this can be broadly implemented for all of our patients.\"\n\nAuthorship:Mark A.

Today,Fort Health, a specialty outpatient pediatric mental health provider, announced that it has partnered withCollevato train its therapists with AI avatar-led, face-to-face simulations. By providing highly relevant and engaging customized scenarios, Fort Health is able to rapidly upskill its therapists using evidence-based therapeutic protocols, ultimately leading to improved client care and operational efficiency. The initial series of custom training scenarios resulted in 83% of clinicians feeling more prepared and 95% able to apply what they have learned.\n\nAbody of researchfrom the National Institute of Medicine shows that current efforts to train clinicians in empirically-based treatments (EBTs) face significant challenges, as they typically provide only didactic training with no examination of applied skills, follow-up support, or implementation feedback. Studies emphasize the importance of role-play skill practice and ongoing expert guidance to ensure clinicians maintain high fidelity to EBT protocols and deliver effective interventions to patients. Compounded by thebehavioral health care workforce shortage,these limitations underscore the need for innovative training approaches to address challenges in a cost-effective and scalable manner.\n\n\"AI-powered avatar simulations are revolutionizing therapist training by enabling immersive, risk-free practice of critical decision-making and patient interactions,\" saidNatalie Schneider, founding CEO of Fort Health. \"Colleva's AI coaching platform empowers us to design tailored, dynamic scenarios that mirror real-world challenges, providing therapists with hands-on experience in applying evidence-based treatment protocols. By leveraging AI patient avatars, we are transforming mental health training—making it more proactive, personalized, and scalable to meet the growing demand for high-quality care.\"\n\nHow it Works\n\nUsing Fort Health's agentic AI training platform – which is modeled on the evidence-based treatment protocol, the Unified Protocol for children, adolescents, and caregivers – therapists conduct realistic role plays with custom avatars and receive personalized feedback to identify areas for improvement and highlight strengths. The series of interactive scenarios are a safe space to practice and develop therapeutic techniques. To help therapists build and demonstrate their proficiency, there are three scenarios representative of the patient population that Fort Health treats. Each of the scenario's avatars have six personalities to choose from, allowing for more realistic and varied practice. Each custom simulation uses generative AI to analyze both content and delivery. Personalized feedback is based on specific EBT objectives and CBT competency frameworks. Therapists are also provided instant feedback on soft skill competencies important to successful therapy outcomes.\n\n\"We are harnessing AI not to replace human therapists, but to make them more effective,\" saidMichael Palys, co-founder and president of Colleva. \"It's been wonderful working in partnership with the Fort Health team as they share our collective vision of using AI role plays and simulations to enhance human skills in areas like mental health where these skills are so critically important to successful patient outcomes. The ability to offer personalized 1:1 feedback at scale is a game changer. My father's own career in psychiatry has made this particular project very special to me, and it's been wonderful to see the excitement among practitioners.\"\n\n\"As a therapist, I know how challenging it can be to translate the professional training we receive into real life interactions with children and families. I also know how uncomfortable and anxiety provoking it can be for a therapist to participate in role plays or live observations. Having a private, safe space to fumble and trip as you sharpen your skill set is a game changer for most therapists,\" saidLindsay Henderson, PsyD, founding clinical director, Fort Health. \"Utilizing AI simulations as a training platform to increase therapist's ability to deliver EBT at a higher fidelity will be key to solving for our nation's youth mental health needs.\"\n\n\"What a unique training opportunity! It allows me to practice and improve my clinical skills in a way I've never before experienced. I love getting immediate feedback which I can implement in real time,\" said Licensed Professional Counselor Catherine Murray.\n\nAbout Fort Health\n\nFounded in 2022, Fort Health is a specialty outpatient pediatric mental health provider.

    "full_content": "Smartwatchesaren't just for sending texts and monitoring your fitness activities. Designed to look like a regular watch, the UnaliWear Kanega Watch (starting at $149.99 upfront, then $59.95 per month) is amedical alert devicethat connects you to an emergency response center with the touch of a button or a simple voice command. It calls for help when you fall down, and also tells you when to take your medicine. If you don't need fall detection, however, we prefer theMedical Guardian MGMovethanks to its superior caregiver tools and lower subscription pricing.\n\nAvailable with a black, champagne gold, or rose gold bezel, the Kanega Watch face measures 1.6 inches in diameter and is 0.5 inches thick. The screen is a bit larger than that of the Medical Guardian MGMove (1.25 inches in diameter), and the Kanega’s black-and-gold mesh wrist band makes the watch look and feel bulkier. It has anIP67 waterproof ratingand you get several straps in the box so you can pick the one that best fits your wrist.\n\nAnother reason for the additional heft are the two rechargeable battery packs (one on each side of the watch) that you can remove and charge via the three-port battery charger that comes in the box. You get a total of four batteries in the package, which means you can keep two of them charged at all times. The batteries are easy to swap out, and the process doesn't even require you to remove the watch. UnaliWear recommends changing the batteries daily (they last up to 36 hours) and provides free replacements when they reach the end of their charging life (approximately 18 months with regular use).\n\nThe Kanega Watch has GPS, cellular (Verizon), and Wi-Fi radios that can help pinpoint your exact location in the event of an emergency. Its screen uses white text on a black background, a departure from the full-color touch screens you get with theLifeStation Sidekick Smartand the Medical Guardian MGMove watches. According to UnaliWear, the high-contrast monochrome display is easier to read if you suffer from glaucoma or macular degeneration.\n\nThe right side of the watch houses a speaker and a microphone for two-way hands-free communication and for issuing voice commands. To communicate with the watch using voice commands, begin with the phrase “Fred Astaire,” which is the watch’s name. Once you activate the voice command option, you can ask questions such as, “Fred Astaire, what time is it?” and “Fred Astaire, what day is it?” to hear an audible response. If you say, “Fred Astaire, call the operator,” or, “Fred Astaire, get help,” the watch places a call to the 24/7 emergency response center.\n\nAlso on the right side is a crown button that you use to initiate a call to a representative and to navigate through each screen. Press the button for five seconds to connect to an agent, or press and release it quickly to display the current time, day, date, and battery level. Press it a second time to view just the day of the week and date, and then quickly press it twice to toggle to a screen that displays the time, date, battery level, and Wi-Fi signal strength. Continue to single press the crown button to toggle through the settings screens where you select a watch face (you get 12- or 24-hour format and digital or analog options), adjust the speaker volume and screen brightness, update phone settings, enable airplane mode, view a how-to tutorial, and obtain a security code to use with the web portal.\n\nOne important note: The Kanega Watch requires a subscription. You can choose between an annual or quarterly plan, but both require you to pay a one-time setup fee ($149.99 and $249.99 respectively). You pay upfront for each plan—either $719.40 per year (the equivalent of $59.95 per month) or $209.85 per quarter (the equivalent of $69.95 per month).\n\nSign up for the Lab Report newsletter to receive PCMag's latest product reviews, buying advice, and insights.\n\nBy clicking Sign Me Up, you confirm you are 16+ and agree to ourTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nYour subscription has been confirmed. Keep an eye on your inbox!\n\nFor comparison, LifeStation's monthly plan for its Sidekick Smart watch costs $43.95 per month. The Medical Guardian MGMove watch has an upfront cost of $199.99 and requires a $39.95-per-month subscription ($36.62 per month if you pay annually), but neither it nor the Sidekick Smart offer fall detection.\n\nThe Kanega watch offers generic medicine reminders, but lacks many of the features that you get with the MGMove including a built-in pedometer, as well as a companion app that allows you to send messages to trusted contacts and set reminders for appointments and medications. The My Guardian app for the MGMove also lets people in your support circle monitor your emergency alert events and pinpoint your exact location on a map.\n\nUnaliWear offers a web portal for the Kanega Watch, but all you can do here is enter up to five daily medicine reminders and configure Wi-Fi settings.\n\nTo prepare the Kanega Watch for first use, you need to charge the batteries for approximately two hours. After you install the batteries in the watch, press the crown button to launch a voice-activated tutorial. The voice prompts tell you how to get the time by asking for it, how to use the help button, and how to test the watch. You also receive an email to schedule an onboarding call with a UnaliWear representative to go over things like how the watch and voice activation works, how emergency dispatch and fall detection features function, where the microphone is, and how to install batteries.\n\nWe test response time by clocking how long it takes for a device to connect us with a live response agent after we press the call button. The Kanega Watch took an average of 46 seconds to reach a representative in our tests. That’s a bit slower than the Medical Guardian MGMove (26 seconds) and the LifeStation Sidekick Smart (28 seconds), but that response time is still under a minute, which is good.\n\nThe GPS radio was always accurate in testing, and the emergency response agents we spoke with were friendly and professional. Two-way audio sounded clear and adequately loud, too.\n\nThe Kanega Watch is an inconspicuous medical alert device that can connect you to an emergency response agent if you need help, no matter where you are. Fall detection  and voice control are its main benefits, but you can set generic medicine reminders via a web portal, too. That said, you don't get the mobile app and caregiver tools we expect from medical alert devices, and the required subscription is quite pricey. Our Editors’ Choice winner, the Medical Guardian MGMove, is more affordable and offers a better set of features, though it doesn't detect falls.\n\nBest Watch for Fall Detection\n\nUnaliWear’s Kanega Watch detects when you fall and supports voice control, but lacks the caregiver options we expect from medical alert devices.\n\nI’ve been working with computers for ages, starting with a multi-year stint in purchasing for a major IBM reseller in New York City before eventually landing at PCMag (back when it was still in print asPC Magazine). I spent more than 14 years on staff, most recently as the director of operations for PC Labs, before hitting the freelance circuit as a contributing editor.\n\nRead John R.'s full bio",

    "date": "2022-07-25",
    "full_content": "FALMOUTH, Maine — It’s harvest time on Casco Bay.\n\nBriana Warner is dressed for this late spring morning in padded rubber overalls, raincoat, rubber boots and neon yellow gloves that come up above her elbows. Just off the coast of Falmouth, she hangs off the side of a Zodiac boat and uses a gaff (hook) to hoist from the water a neon green buoy attached to a thick white rope. Warner struggles and finally gets her hands around the rope. The line drips with long, shimmering, translucent ribbons of green sugar kelp.\n\nSeaweed: An unusual snack for cows, a powerful fix for the climate\n\nWarner’s face lights up as she inspects the seaweed. “They’re ready for harvest,” she declares.\n\nAs the CEO and president ofAtlantic Sea Farms, the 38-year-old Warner is using seaweed to quietly revolutionize Maine’s struggling fishing industry.\n\nUp and down the Maine coast, thousands of lines like this have been planted by fishermen growing seaweed in partnership with her company. In the fall, the fishermen plant tiny kelp seeds on the 1,000-foot-long ropes, and by late spring, attached to each one is close to 6,000 pounds of fresh sugar kelp. The seaweed is harvested, flash frozen and used to make kelp cubes for smoothies, as well as seaweed salad, seaweed kraut and more.\n\nSeaweed is Maine’s new cash crop.\n\nFor generations, coastal Maine has been supported by a different underwater resource: the lobster. Lobstering is woven into virtually every aspect of life in coastal communities; tax revenue, jobs and the state’s identity depend on it. But as climate change causes Maine’s coastal waters to warm, underwater life, and the economy built around it, has shifted dramatically.\n\nTheGulf of Maine is warming faster than 96 percent of the world’s oceans— increasing at a rate of 0.09 degrees Fahrenheit per year. These warming temperatures have forced the lobster population to migrate north, seeking colder waters, and the impact on Maine fishermen has been profound.\n\nSeaweed is easy to grow, sustainable and nutritious. But it’ll never be kale.\n\nKeith Miller, 67, a second-generation lobsterman, has been lobstering for more than 50 years, fishing in Wheeler’s Bay between Spruce Head and Tenants Harbor. When he saw the dramatic impact of climate change on his industry, he knew he had to plan for the six months of the year — between fall and spring — when he couldn’t fish for lobster. He heard about a program in Rockland, Maine, at theIsland Institute, which helps coastal communities thrive, educating lobstermen about aquaculture.\n\n“I could choose between oyster farming, mussel farming or kelp,” Miller says in his thick Maine accent. “Water ’round here is too shallow for mussels, and oysters are a year-round job. I wanted to keep lobstering half the year, so I chose seaweed.”\n\nAt the time, Warner was the Island Institute’s first economic development officer. A former Foreign Service diplomat, she says she’s always been interested in “finding solutions rather than being part of the problem.” After serving in Libya, Guinea and several other countries, she moved to Maine with her husband, who grew up in the state, and started a family. Her goal was to apply her diplomatic skills to making a difference in the state’s coastal and food communities.\n\n“The question we asked was this: In communities where lobster is everything, how do we prepare for the future along the Maine coast and diversify to face climate change?” Warner says. “When you’re self-employed and your entire community is dependent on one industry, and you’re totally at the whim of Mother Nature, overdependence on one monoculture is very scary.”\n\nMiller is one of several dozen lobstermen accepted into the aquaculture program. He describes the past five years he’s spent farming seaweed in the “offseason” as “life changing.”\n\n“My first year kelping, I brought in 2,200 pounds,” he says. “But this year, my harvest was 170,000 pounds. I keep telling folks, ‘My ship is coming in!’”\n\nRoasted seaweed is the powerhouse ingredient in this pantry pasta\n\nIn summer 2018, Warner was offered the position of CEO at Atlantic Sea Farms. When she started, two kelp farms were yielding around 30,000 pounds total. The company now works with 27 partner farmers, and the 2022 harvest brought in just under 1 million pounds of seaweed. The company’s products are now sold in more than 2,000 stores across the country, as well as in restaurants and college cafeterias. In 2021, the company was responsible for 85 percent of the line-produced seaweed in the country.\n\nAnother farmer the company works with is Justin Papkee, 31, who fishes near Long Island in Casco Bay. “This country is way behind others in understanding how good kelp is for you and the environment,” Papkee says. “Briana is doing a great job figuring out ways to market it.”\n\nPapkee, who still lobsters year-round and farms kelp a few days a week during the harvest season, says he’s able to maintain his crew of three year-round and bring in extra income. Although he’s hesitant to talk about money, he says this year, after four seasons of kelp farming, he is “in the black.”\n\nWarner calls seaweed “a shock absorber against the volatility of the lobster industry.” When she talks about seaweed and the industry, her speech gains momentum and her passion is on display. “The best thing about kelp is that it is the most climate-friendly food you can eat!” Seaweed, she explains, is farmed without land, pesticides or fresh water.\n\nThe environmental benefits of growing seaweed go even further. “There’s so much carbon in the air, and when carbon hits the ocean surface, the ocean absorbs it and changes the pH and degrades shellfish,” Warner says. “Seaweed absorbs the carbon and nitrogen in the water. When you harvest seaweed, you are removing carbon with it and leaving behind a healthier body of water.”\n\nWarner is quick to point out that growing seaweed is not a climate change solution. “It is,” she explains, “a climate change adaptation strategy. It is better than anything else we can eat.” But seaweed, Warner says, can have a massive local climate change effect. To illustrate her point, she says that when mussels are planted on ropes underwater after a kelp harvest, the shell strength is almost twice as strong in those areas, thanks to the removal of the excess carbon.\n\nUntil recently, seaweed was always sold dried and, most often, came from Asia or was harvested from the wild in U.S. waters. Atlantic Sea Farms is one of several American companies that sells seaweed that is never dyed or dried. After it is flash frozen, it’s used to make kelp cubes, a nutritious boost to smoothies, salad dressings and sauces. In raw form, the seaweed adds crunch and a briny, umami-rich flavor to seaweed salad, Atlantic Sea Farms’ Sea-Beet Kraut and a take on kimchi called Sea-Chi.\n\nAccording to Lia Heifetz, 31, ofBarnacle Foodsin Juneau, Alaska, “seaweed is an ocean multivitamin.” It’s rich in potassium, iron, magnesium, calcium and antioxidants. Heifetz and her two partners harvest wild bull kelp seaweed, which is prolific around the shores of Juneau, as well as farmed kelp. Bull kelp is unique because it can grow a stipe (or stem) that is 30 feet long and, according to Heifetz, offers a unique texture and flavor similar to apples and fresh bell pepper. Barnacle Foods freezes the kelp and uses it to make hot sauce, salsa, pickles, Bloody Mary mixes and more. Heifetz hopes to increase the amount of kelp farming they do in coming years but says that in Alaska and many other parts of the country, obtaining permits and licenses involves lengthy hurdles.\n\n“We have a unique opportunity here in Alaska,” she says. “We have 30,000 miles of coast in the state, primarily undeveloped. Consumers are looking for a way to use their food dollars to support causes that are important to them. And seaweed checks all the boxes.”\n\nWarner has also been spreading the word about the power of seaweed. She was recently invited to the2022 Davos World Economic Forumto speak as part of a program for 20 “ecopreneurs.” She focused her talk on America’s “broken food system” and the potential for Maine’s seaweed aquaculture industry as “a model where people and the planet come first.” But mostly, she says, she tried to leave the top leaders who attended the annual summit with something positive.\n\n“What we’re doing with seaweed in Maine,” she told them, “is giving people hope and giving people an opportunity to take hold of their own future in the face of a very uncertain climate.”",

    "full_content": "A couple of years ago, Anne Carlson — the founder of Jiminy’s, a dog food start-up — conducted a taste test with her dog, Timber.\n\nShe filled half of his bowl with the meat-based food the Great Dane was used to eating, and she filled the other half with Jiminy’s Cricket Crave, a kibble made from cricket powder, oats, quinoa, sweet potato and other plant-based ingredients. Then she stood back as he dug in.\n\nTimber’s response was miraculous: He sniffed his options, then devoured the Cricket Crave and licked his lips contentedly, leaving the other side untouched.\n\n“It was one of those moments when you’re like, ‘Oh, this is so good,’ ” Carlson said. This summer, Petco stocked shelves in 800 stores with Jiminy’s dog food. Along with the surprise of seeing pets wolf down insects, Carlson says customers often tell her, “I didn’t even realize I could be fighting climate change with my dog.”\n\nA third of all food in the U.S. gets wasted. Fixing that could help fight climate change.\n\nMany pet owners reflexively bark “No!” when their dog or cat prepares to feast on a bug. But despite what scientists call the “yuck factor,” insects could be a sustainable secret ingredient for the booming pet food industry. About a quarter of Americans are cutting back on eating meat, many alarmed by the fact that livestock farming causes up to 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Yet for all the humans observing meatless Mondays, opting for Impossible burgers or swearing off meat entirely, 180 million furry members of U.S. households are fed beef, lamb, poultry or pork in just about every meal.\n\nResearchers at the University of California at Los Angelesestimatethat dogs and cats account for up to 30 percent of the environmental impact of U.S. meat consumption. If American pets made up their own country, they’d eat the fifth-most meat globally. And fueled by a surge of pandemic pet acquisitions, Americans now spend more than $40 billion annually on pet food and treats — with many stores offering almost exclusively traditional meat-based options.\n\nBut there are signs of a shift. Many pet food companies — including the two biggest, Mars and Nestlé — are developing insect-based alternatives for dogs and cats, and according to a Petco survey, 55 percent of customers like the idea of using sustainable alternative protein ingredients in pet food.\n\nMillennials, the fastest-growing contingent of pet owners,are keenon buying environmentally friendly products and willing to pay a premium for them, according to Francesca Mahoney, Petco’s head of sustainability.\n\n“There’s an appetite for pet parents to spend a little bit more if something resonates with their values,” Mahoney said. Petco wants half of its products to be sustainable by 2025.\n\nWould you eat insects to help save the planet? These companies are betting yes.\n\nFor now, some pet owners might balk at the higher price of these alternatives. Petco sells a 3.5-pound bag of Jiminy’s Cricket Crave for $21.95 — almost three times more than Purina’s chicken and rice dry food. But the cost of insects, driven up temporarily by nutritional testing and a supply chain with enormous room to scale, is expected to drop as the market grows.\n\nCarlson founded Jiminy’s in 2016, after reading a United Nations report identifying crickets as a sustainable source of food for humans. After all, insects are already a culinary staple in much of the world: grasshoppers fried in Thailand, worms floating in mezcal in Mexico, caterpillars boiled in the Congo. The edible insect market isprojectedto grow eightfold globally by 2030, to $8 billion.\n\nCarlson herself drinks smoothies with a dash of cricket powder. Her company sells Cricket Crave as well as Good Grub, which derives protein from black soldier fly larvae. As a pet food, “there are no compromises,” she said. “It’s humane. It’s hypoallergenic. It’s delicious.”\n\nAnd, Carlson added, insects produce something many pet owners obsessively monitor: “solid poops.” Crickets and fly larvae are similarly digestible to traditional meat and provide comparable protein, plus vital amino acids and other minerals, according to Kelly Swanson, an animal nutritional scientist at the University of Illinois.\n\nAlthough many pets eat the same menu of wet and dry food every day of their lives, Swanson says a rotational diet is often the most nutritious. When cutting back on meat, “it’s not all or nothing,” he says, adding that for his own diet, “I’ll take out one or two meat meals per week. With pets, 10 percent of protein coming from insects adds up sustainability-wise.”\n\nAn acre of land can produce about 192 pounds of beef annually, or 265 pounds of poultry, according to Carlson. The same spaceyields65,000 pounds of cricket or 130,000 pounds of black soldier fly larvae. Farming insects releases substantially less carbon and methane, and, according to Jiminy’s “carbon pawprint” calculator, switching a Golden Retriever to an insect-based diet saves 4.4 million gallons of water per year.\n\nMuch of Jiminy’s crickets come from Entomo Farms in Ontario, Canada. The company, which expects sales to increase fourfold this year, retrofitted rural chicken farms to house millions of crickets in climate-controlled “cabins.” One might think a barn full of crickets would be as deafening as a Toronto Raptors playoff game, but no: Crickets only chirp in old age, and Entomo’s crickets live 80 percent of their natural life span before being processed.\n\nMy name is Max, and I have a cicada problem: A tale of a dog who can’t stop eating the bugs\n\nIn August, the Association of American Feed Control Officials, an influential body for establishing pet nutritional standards, voted to approve black soldier fly larvae for dog food. (AAFCO has yet to issue a verdict on crickets.) Jiminy’s gets its dried fly larvae from Kentucky-based EnviroFlight, which opened the first commercial-scale U.S. fly farm in 2019. At any given time there are billions of creatures under one roof — about 5 percent flies and 95 percent larvae, living vertically up to 15 feet.\n\nFlies are raised in a “circular economy,” said EnviroFlight President Liz Koutsos, an animal nutritionist. They are fed with byproducts from local bourbon distilleries and bakeries, and the waste from larvae then goes toward animal feed. “Nothing ends up in the landfill,” Koutsos said.\n\nMany meat-based pet foods use animal byproducts humans won’t eat — mostly bones and organs like the spleen, kidney and heart — supposedly reducing their footprint. Caitlyn Dudas, executive director of the Pet Sustainability Coalition, says the pet food industry would be better off dialing back its dependence on factory livestock farming. “We are not clear of responsibility for the farming practices for our products” from animals, she said, whereas “insect protein is legitimately sustainable.”\n\nFor now, Europeans have a greater appetite to serve insects to their pets. Nestlé’s Purina line of insect-based dry dog food is sold in about 200 stores in Switzerland, and the company expects distribution to double by October. This spring, Mars — having found that 47 percent of Europeans would buy insect-based cat food — launched a black soldier fly larvae-based cat kibble, Lovebug, in the United Kingdom.\n\n“With protein sourcing, there is a symbiotic relationship between the human food supply chain and the pet supply chain,” said Deri Watkins, president of Mars Petcare’s European division. “I'd be surprised if five years from now, you're not seeing the option of insect protein on a mainstream supermarket shelf.”\n\nCan you eat cicadas? Yes, and here’s the best way to catch, cook and snack on them.\n\nCompanies are still refining how to market insects, too. When Jonathan Persofsky performed focus-group testing for his Green Gruff cricket-based dog treats, packages covered with images of bugs scored very poorly. When he explained the nutritional and environmental upside of crickets, however, 88 percent of people said they’d buy his product.\n\nMaryanne Murphy, a veterinary nutritionist at the University of Tennessee, isn’t surprised that people are turned off by the sight of bugs. The pet food industry already panders to human palettes, marketing such novelties as Memphis-style BBQ chicken for dogs and seafood paella for cats. “When I talk to [pet] owners about it, they say, ‘Would I want to eat insects?’ ” Murphy said.\n\nAlthough humans can easily cut back on mainstream meat options, many people question whether that’s true of their pets. Cats are called “obligate carnivores,” meaning they depend on the micronutrients found in meat. But “insect protein fulfills that need,” Watkins said, and at a minimum, cats and dogs appear to benefit from insects as a complementary protein source.\n\nD.C.-based Chippin also makes treats from cricket powder, plus dog foods made with spirulina or invasive carp. “It’s shocking,” CEO Haley Russell said, “that you see people walking through Whole Foods, putting plant-based foods in their reusable bags, but when you hit the pet food aisle so much of it is conventional meat protein.”\n\nAbout a year ago, Jonathan Carrion, owner of Brooklyn Tails Pet Food, began selling cricket treats. He liked that they’re high in protein, and remembered watching his cat enjoy eating insects she found outside.\n\nBut after displaying them in the front of his store, Carrion decided not to restock. “About 50 percent of customers thought crickets were disgusting,” he said, “like I told them it was made out of cockroaches.”\n\nUltimately, there’s still a major learning curve to overcome in the United States, even in the most environmentally conscientious neighborhoods. He thinks insect-based pet food companies should offer free samples or provide brochures, like CBD-based pet products do, to explain the many benefits of feeding insects to pets.\n\n“People who took samples would come right back, asking, ‘Hey, do you have any more cricket stuff?’ ” Carrion said. “Animals love it.”\n\nSign up for the latest news about climate change, energy and the environment, delivered every Thursday\n\nMore on climate change\n\nUnderstanding our climate:Global warming is a real phenomenon, and weather disasters areundeniably linked to it.

Since nutrition and maintaining a healthy weight are particular concerns for small dog breeds, it's really important to feed your small dog the best of the best, the healthiest of the healthiest.\n\nSo, we vetted (pun intended) the top dog foods for the smallest of our furry friends. These are the six best dog foods designed for small dog breeds.\n\nThe Farmer's Dog is one of the most popular dog food subscription services to come about in recent years, with a laser focus on nutrition and using the best—meaning, the freshest—ingredients possible. Owners start by taking a quiz about their dog's health, weight, breed, etc. so that TFD can personalize food to each dog's unique needs. You can then specify how often you want to feed your dog (once or twice daily) and the proper portions based on your dog's size, breed, age and weight will show up at your doorstep. It's a meaningful option for all dogs—my dog is about 30 pounds, and this is what I personally feed her. But TFD is particularly good for small dog breeds, which may have more trouble maintaining a healthy weight, as well as picky eaters (as smaller dogs tend to be), and dogs with allergies. Speaking of allergies, if your dog has a chicken or turkey allergy, The Farmer's Dog beef recipe may be a better option.\n\nBuy at The Farmer's Dog.\n\nNom Nom is another convenient dog food subscription service that is personalized to your dog's individual nutrition needs.
